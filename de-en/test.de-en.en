Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran 's destabil@@ ising activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
In 911 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Shooting Gir@@ l@@ friend
In a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Shannon Lam@@ b told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his " sweet dog " was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
Inside the home , officers found Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss ' body and a hand-@@ written note scri@@ bbled on a white legal pad : " I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , " read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school 's campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , Ethan Schmidt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.@@ m .
He said Lam@@ b made the fat@@ eful 911 call sometime after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
Students said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the " wonderful people " he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
A student who praised Lam@@ b , Brandon Be@@ avers , said he also seemed ag@@ itated and jit@@ tery , " like there was something wrong with him . "
Another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 academic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Recent changes in the university 's hiring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn 't know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lam@@ b 's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be appreh@@ ended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38-@@ caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el Johnson .
His car was still running in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
He received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
One of Lam@@ b 's longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
All the girls would melt when he was around , " said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 911 call , Lam@@ b said " I killed my wife , " but there was no record of them ever marrying .
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bay@@ ou in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss ' ex-husband , Shawn O '@@ Ste@@ en , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who 's now 19 .
" She was completely devastated , " O '@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blues .
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together in the occasional gig .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ ent@@ iss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything am@@ iss .
" Just a happy couple , " he said .
We were cutting up and throwing one-@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
Schmidt , the slain professor , directed the first-@@ year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his frat@@ ernity and student government .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ l@@ elight memorial .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang " Bright Morning Star " and " Ama@@ zing Grace . "
Cl@@ asses resume Wednesday .
" We 're trying to get our students to come back , " La@@ For@@ ge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily W@@ ag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ ent@@ iss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .
Toys R Us Plans to H@@ ire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won 't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .

While the holidays themselves are months away , holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox Jok@@ es About His ' Date ' With Princess Diana
The premiere of " Back to the Future " was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally .
It was note@@ worthy because of personal reasons , too .
" We were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it da@@ wns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me , " he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , " Back in Time . "

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia 's stepped up military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
The U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly 's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers " made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . "
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ pper .
Others have dismissed him as a joke .
And some are holding out for an implo@@ sion .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls , it hasn 't worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump 's lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul 's nomination chances .
Of course , it 's still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
P@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like Je@@ b Bush 's Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump 's staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to topple him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn 't just a passing phase :
Trump 's favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
Rou@@ ghly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ iac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump .
Two-@@ thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee .
In a CNN / OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if Trump were the nominee .
Only two in 10 say they would be " upset " if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be " enthusiastic " vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
On the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be " dis@@ satisfied " or " upset " if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
A majority of Republicans don 't see Trump 's temper@@ ament as a problem .
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ aned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Monday 's ABC News / Washington Post poll .
The same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation caucus state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ iac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn 't have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / OR@@ C poll out last week .
That 's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
Full disclosure : GOP voters haven 't had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
Still , it shows that a pl@@ ur@@ ality of GOP voters see Trump 's campaign as plausible .
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
Some pundits point out that the splin@@ tered field is likely contributing to Trump 's lead , while anti@@ -T@@ rump support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
But a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothe@@ tical head-to-@@ head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
He leads Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Rub@@ io by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ si@@ ch and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
He 's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head-to-@@ head .
A bare majority of Donald Trump 's supporters say they 've made up their minds .
A new CBS / NY@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
Obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
Still , Trump 's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neuro@@ surgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico " rap@@ ists " in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
Some are worried that Trump 's bomb@@ ast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ branding efforts .
But according to Monday 's new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday 's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
And they are angry at Washington , too .
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent " un@@ satisfied " and 21 percent " mad as hell . "
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea mud@@ flats .
On this road one square metre of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
" On Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , " says a study - hence the high prices .
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre .
Of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square metre for student dig@@ s in Munich is not really low .
Compared with Germany 's top areas , however , this price seems likes pean@@ uts .
Property service En@@ gel & Vol@@ kers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square metre .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per qu@@ are metre , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can 't afford it ...
In@@ ci@@ dentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
Champions League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and G@@ ö@@ tz@@ e
Double goal scorer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Ol@@ yp@@ i@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it got better .
A confident start to the Champions League season .
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario G@@ ö@@ tz@@ e brought about a dream start to their " Milan Mission " in the see@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
Trainer Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola 's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller 's brace ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and G@@ ö@@ tz@@ e 's goal ( 89@@ th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The twel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Guar@@ di@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to Munich .
With his 28th goal in the Champions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gr@@ acious help of Ol@@ y@@ mi@@ ac@@ os goalie Roberto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
" We aren 't going to under@@ estimate them , " promised Bayern captain Philli@@ pp Lahm before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 31,@@ 68@@ 8 hot-@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won their six most recent premiere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , Atletico Madrid and Juventus Turin .
In 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a D@@ ort@@ mund stumbled here too .
But Bayern , undefeated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
Attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa , who rarely got past former Brun@@ sw@@ ick player Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ oui , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
In the 67@@ th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in the first half .
First when Olympi@@ ac@@ os striker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pole 's header from the line in the 26th minute .
Then with a shot which the goalie par@@ ried with his knee in the 35@@ th minute .
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus were able to needle them .
But they could count on goalkeeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
For example when he steered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 56@@ th minute .
Guar@@ di@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng .
Mario G@@ ö@@ tz@@ e , back in the squad following muscle problems , initially sat on the sidelines .
The world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training , said Sporting Director Mat@@ th@@ ias Sam@@ mer on Sky : " If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being malicious . "
At the first change , Guar@@ di@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in Kings@@ ley Com@@ an for the stricken Le@@ wand@@ owski in the 59@@ th minute .
G@@ ö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vidal in the 76@@ th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
Before the match there was a riot in the stadium .
After a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing masks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus from behind their fence with words and gestures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
Smo@@ kers at a greater risk of losing teeth
Smo@@ kers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Po@@ ts@@ dam .
The good news is : if you give up the risk decreases fast .
Smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nut@@ r@@ itional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Po@@ ts@@ dam .
Compared to non-@@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers .
The scientists monitored more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
The main reasons for tooth loss are car@@ ies and inflammation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
Smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , emphas@@ ise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
It has not been clar@@ ified to what extent smoking raises the risk of car@@ ies .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the " Journal of D@@ ental Research . "
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-@@ smokers ' , declared lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be persuaded to become non-@@ smokers , declared study leader H@@ ein@@ er Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : " Smoking shor@@ tens the lif@@ esp@@ an . "
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by tooth@@ lessness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
The new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rh@@ ine at C@@ ologne
Arch@@ ae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rh@@ ine in C@@ ologne .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed skelet@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rh@@ ine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Hist@@ ori@@ ans have been in search of so-called architectural mon@@ um@@ ents since the start of construction work on the Rh@@ ine .
The museum , as the department for archae@@ ological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of C@@ ologne .
The archae@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard .
It is already known from text documents that a fort@@ ress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
Besides the remains of the fort@@ ress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church , has also been discovered .
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in Ge@@ il@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ -@@ Lin@@ der@@ n , police are asking for help from the general public .
Early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of M@@ ö@@ n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
According to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident .
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by ambulance .
Investig@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
It is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something .
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lin@@ der@@ n station , Zie@@ gel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ str@@ asse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Str@@ asse ( L@@ 364 ) .
Any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police ho@@ tline on 0800 / 68@@ 8 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TT@@ IP
To def@@ use the controversy over the planned Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system .
According to this , the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which correspon@@ ds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
" We want to set up a system which citizens trust , " stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m , when introducing it .
The Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come in equal proportions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would allow for appeals to be made against jud@@ gements .
Up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbit@@ rator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , commented Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
Investor State Disp@@ ute Settlement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
Tra@@ ditional arbitration courts are criticised by advers@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers , make national laws null and void , or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission 's proposals inadequate .
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State for the Economy , Mat@@ th@@ ias Mach@@ n@@ ig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m 's plans .
The European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
When talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
Negoti@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer ten@@ able .
Ex@@ quis@@ ite folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in C@@ ologne .
Bes@@ ide him stands a flip chart on which the sh@@ y-@@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the pictu@@ res@@ que US state of Michigan in fel@@ t-@@ tip pen .
The entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Stevens 's performance .
Refer@@ ring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his me@@ ticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly con@@ tri@@ ved songs .
Where they originated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then Stevens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
His third album , " Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , " released in 2003 , features clever@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might drift at any time into amazing opul@@ ence .
Rum@@ our has it that " Michigan " was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rh@@ ine area , " Seven Sw@@ ans " came out , bursting positive expectations .
Stevens seems to have down@@ sized here .
Playing live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later the New York-based musician returns to his series .
With " Illinois " ( " Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens Inv@@ ites You To : Come On Fe@@ el The Illin@@ o@@ ise " ) in 2005 , a widely acclaimed master@@ piece is released .
Ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ listic sophist@@ ication .
The album clim@@ bs the American Billboard charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then serves up " The Age of Ad@@ z " ( 2010 ) , an elaborate electronic set piece .
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated , but supported by progr@@ ammed sequ@@ ences or beats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes .
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge fluo@@ rescent stage decor@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Hamburg M@@ ehr kept in the dark !
Since March the theatre has primarily presented " Carrie and Lowell . "
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
Without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister 's Questions
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's debut at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ enly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lot@@ ted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrutin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
He has called for " less theatre and more facts " at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had " stood in respectful silence " and did recognise the " hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . "
But a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC Two 's News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem " ir@@ respective " of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin B@@ rant says policy differences are also " st@@ acking up " within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government 's cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
Hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was " very clear " that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has " crowd sourced " ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ lington North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both " repar@@ tee " and trading bar@@ bs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business secretary , will de@@ put@@ ise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the " Pun@@ ch and Judy " style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key barometer of a leader 's judgement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
The pound jumped following data showing a pick@@ -up in UK wage growth , while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
Between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
The rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
Sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 505 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the stand@@ -out stock on the market , jumping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
A deal would combine the world 's two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ ont 's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
Shares in Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-@@ cutting strategy .
Shares in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.3 % , after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to " sell . "
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6m .
J@@ D Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean " more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . "
But that spending power is unlikely to outw@@ eigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
The costs could hit J@@ D Sports ' expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Justin Bie@@ ber in the capital city : on a Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bie@@ ber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
A ridiculous 21 years young , a w@@ imp@@ y kid with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
Probably even more .
At the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
And the under-@@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
Like Wik@@ toria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
The 15-year-old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carlton .
Not so bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Including Eva and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
But the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Po@@ ts@@ dam@@ er Plat@@ z since 7 o 'clock in the morning .
The Bie@@ ber building : their i@@ dol , whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa earns in six months .
At least .
She says : " My Vik@@ toria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the gramm@@ ar school at the moment . "
" I 'm fulfilling her dream for her . "
Comp@@ ul@@ sory education ?
Who wants that ?
Not the fans .
Nor Bie@@ ber himself .
He is financially secure anyway .
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bowl , a two-year deal with an anti-@@ spot company po@@ urs many many dollars into Bie@@ ber 's account .
And for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bie@@ ber c@@ ashes in as well .
When Justin Bie@@ ber drinks coffee people go@@ g@@ gle through the window .
He has loo@@ ted more than a hundred million like that .
Some say the hype goes too far .
Others point out that after all Bie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single " What do you mean ? " at number one .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
At least that 's what he says .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster suggests the idea of potato don@@ er k@@ eb@@ abs to Lebanese man
Pot@@ atoes or don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab ?
You can have both - in the potato k@@ eb@@ ab that Ol@@ den@@ burg snack bar owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has created .
In@@ spired by the slogan " potatoes instead of k@@ eb@@ abs " on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement poster , Al@@ hay put potatoes and meat together on a ske@@ wer .
A poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the slogan " Pot@@ atoes instead of k@@ eb@@ abs " which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
Since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop .
" That is multi-@@ cultural food ! " says Al@@ hay .
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
Because of this , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the sp@@ it holds .
Just enough so that , " They taste much better together , " he reckons .
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Met@@ cash launches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ di incur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia .
Gro@@ cer@@ y wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
As Al@@ di prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ GA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adel@@ aide show .
I@@ GA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough@@ -based ice cream maker Sim@@ mo 's offering taste testing at I@@ GA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liquor and hardware wholes@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
There is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash 's I@@ GA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash 's I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously par@@ och@@ ial and I@@ GA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NS@@ W , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
In a report this week , Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kier@@ ath estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Met@@ cash 's high fixed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Kier@@ ath said .
At the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found I@@ GA shoppers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Met@@ cash 's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash could " highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass ' comments .
But it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ GA 's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash 's food and grocery business , which supplies about 1200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating del@@ e@@ verage as sales and margins come under pressure .
However , the wholes@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shelf prices at Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ GA retailers refur@@ bish stores by adding fast@@ er-@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label groceries .
Met@@ cash chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refurb@@ ishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholes@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the " Special K@@ s , " was dragged into an un@@ welcome spotlight by the infamous Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os sle@@ dge of Stan W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire , with Harrison declaring : " W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka should 've de@@ cked Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that kid . "
While he was last seen smashing a r@@ acqu@@ et after cr@@ amp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been defended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ aly .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain .
" One thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think Than@@ asi 's been dragged into the fra@@ y a little bit , " He@@ aly said .
He did break a r@@ acqu@@ et when he lost when he cramped in the US , but he 's not the first player to break a r@@ acqu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know he wouldn 't be proud of that .
But , really , he 's handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
He 's a great team around him , he 's got a great family around him and I just think he 's been a little hard done by .
He 's a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn 't ever had an issue with the other players , he 's well respected in the locker room , he trains hard , he 's in great shape , he 's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to over@@ look Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the " mutual decision " as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long-term fixture in the team .
" First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [ Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os ] , " He@@ aly said .
And I think Nick , he 's risen very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he 's growing up in the public eye and he 's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we 're trying to support him , we 're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the lim@@ elight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it 's best for the team and it 's best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declares emergency , seals border , de@@ ta@@ ins migrants
Dec@@ laring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
Chaos en@@ sued at the border , as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
Stu@@ ck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries ' checkpoints , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pitched tents and settled in .
But frustr@@ ations were on the rise .
As a police helicopter ho@@ vered above , migrants chanted " Open the border ! " and shouted insul@@ ts at Hungarian riot police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister declared it was " unacceptable " that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , " Ivica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
The turmoil at the Hung@@ ar@@ ian@@ -S@@ erb@@ ian border came a day after the 28-@@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tuesday 's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
Meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a raz@@ or-@@ wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D '@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the raz@@ or wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In the last few months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter ( 13-@@ foot ) raz@@ or-@@ wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
" Due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis , " government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
We are very clear on this : Il@@ legal border crossing is a crime .
Techn@@ ically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , homeland security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
They got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws .
Authorities are quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with raz@@ or wire to close one of them .
Chaos envelop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
Since last month 's CBS News Poll , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates , but those leads have narrowed .
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evapor@@ ated , and she and Sanders are now even .
However , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-@@ digits among liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiast@@ ically support Clinton if she became the party 's nominee .
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
Six percent would not support her .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
Vie@@ ws are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiast@@ ically support her .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiast@@ ically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ trun@@ ner , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open-@@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it 's time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also cited .
As the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don 't think he should .
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party 's nomination , Biden is the top pick .
Among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fif@@ ty-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
Still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
Similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
The Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party 's primary voters .
Maj@@ orities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton 's strength is leadership .
Thir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don 't think Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don 't have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ide@@ ologically .
On all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn 't impacted their overall views of her .
But it 's a different story among the American public overall .
Half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
The public 's views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
It is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by her party 's voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters don 't think of her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
At the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don 't see Trump as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy either .
Both Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush do the best on honesty .
More see Sanders as honest than not , but like Carson , many don 't have an opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a foo@@ thold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last CBS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
But Carson rock@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Trump among colle@@ ge-@@ educated Republican voters .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gov. John Ka@@ si@@ ch , has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
Former Florida Gov. Je@@ b Bush , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rub@@ io all tied for third place with 6 % .
The margin of error for the 37@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is pl@@ us-@@ or-@@ minus 6 % , and was conducted Sept .
The latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind Trump 's 32 % support .
The latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson .
Facing a rising Carson last week , Trump took some pot@@ shots at the retired neuro@@ surgeon , even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump 's faith .
" We need energy , " Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa .
Ple@@ asant temperatures for ba@@ thing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees

A dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German meteor@@ ological office ( DW@@ D ) .
The Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for ba@@ thing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .

Five frat@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing ritual in Pennsylvania 's Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
Members of New York City 's Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si frat@@ ernity brutally assaulted Ch@@ un " Michael " Deng during an initi@@ ation rit@@ e in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
Officials said he was blind@@ folded , sa@@ ddled with a 30-@@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ si frat@@ ernity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
They did , however , find time to change Deng 's clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the frat@@ ernity 's national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
" At this point , members began to hide parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the frat@@ ernity 's well-being over that of Michael Deng 's , " Chief Wagner said .
He could not be revived and he died the next morning .
According to an autopsy report , Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
" Too many families have been devastated as a result of frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , " Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attorney representing Deng 's family , said in a statement .
Frat@@ ern@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thirty-@@ two other frat@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault ha@@ zing and criminal conspiracy .
" We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there 's an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we 're going to hold them accountable as well , " Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the frat@@ ernity and the national frat@@ ernity revoked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
Here 's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stum@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
This we know .
What we don 't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
For the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's aggressi@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That 's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajec@@ tory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
There are , indeed , multiple vari@@ ables at play .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the rat@@ e-@@ hike fuss may have been over@@ done .
" The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of ' cheap money , ' " Julian Jes@@ sop , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
That 's not to say there won 't be effects , however .
Here 's a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
As the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
Once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
" It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-@@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , " Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
More specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob Doll , chief equity strategist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , posted on Bar@@ ron 's .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rat@@ e-@@ hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish .
Rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
In the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
Most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of " whether this time is different , " Deutsche said .
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week 's Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe the FO@@ MC could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
" In our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclip@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ ession peaks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , " the report said .
By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
Fi@@ xed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
For bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately , " Deutsche said .
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between lon@@ ger@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the curve .
High-@@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though " we are still cautious about stretching for yield , " Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst at Schwab , said in an analysis .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , " she wrote .
Short-@@ term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
Broad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
" History shows that ' quality ' stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , " Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
Fir@@ ms with strong balance sheets out@@ paced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
Debt will become a big issue .
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
Sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
Conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for ' d@@ umbing down@@ '
Ar@@ gues it 's becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Brits
Colle@@ ague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn 't original
BBC Radio 3 is " turning into " Classic FM , a leading MP has claimed , piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
Conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be " d@@ umbing down " and is becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from its commercial rival .
" Radio 3 seems to be - I don 't like to use the word " d@@ umbing down " - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM , " he said .
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name .
So , if you 're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you 're actually just mim@@ icking what is already on the market , " Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
And it 's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
" And also , Radio 3 's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important , " he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Britons are less educated about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC 's output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the toes of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced " in a particularly BBC way . "
He added that he wants the Corporation to " find a hit from our own in-house stable " next time it launches an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending licence fee payers ' money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November 's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain 's high streets into ghost towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
Experts say there are signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , ' Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guardian .
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different con@@ texts , such as on the sofa .
But now that is plat@@ e@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flo@@ cked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites .
Experts believe Black Friday , which saw shoppers fight over bargains , could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
For some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mec@@ ca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bo@@ dies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ er@@ als take place in Mec@@ ca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 39@@ 4 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
Car@@ ried al@@ oft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mec@@ ca 's Grand mosque .
D@@ ressed largely in white , mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
The sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto wor@@ ship@@ ers .
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 39@@ 4 injured .
The bodies of 29 of the wor@@ ship@@ ers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mec@@ ca 's Grand Central Mo@@ sque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father@@ -of-@@ four Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram , from Bolton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand Mo@@ sque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pilgrimage .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the ha@@ j@@ j to Mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
Today , King Salman said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the crane 's arm up when it was not in use .
An Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
The news agency 's English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j pilgrimage later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up@@ -to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteor@@ ological officials .
Dozens of cran@@ es surround Mec@@ ca 's Grand Mo@@ sque , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
The Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia 's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Qaida 's late leader Osama bin Laden was a reneg@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every able-@@ bo@@ died Muslim .
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
Officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
Others injured will receive half that amount .
B & Q boss says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men says Veron@@ ique Lau@@ ry
Number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resul@@ ting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
At same time King@@ fis@@ her is closing 60 B & Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner , Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their h@@ ammers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ ushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a hammer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
Because Britons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B & Q .
Veron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new chief executive of King@@ fis@@ her , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
As a result , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B & Q outlets .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
Currently the majority of staff are men .
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : " We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
We need to move more towards a balance .
Fund@@ ament@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
Women play a big part in the decision-making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain 's FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restruc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : " This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fis@@ her posted a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of shutting stores .
As a result of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B & Q , is opening 200 new stores
Officials from A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob in court for breach of trust
Two officials from the Austrian volleyball runner-up champion team A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob attended the Kl@@ agen@@ f@@ urt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion .
The defendants pleaded not guilty .
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May .
The current case was adjourned .
According to senior Public Prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used mon@@ ies from the club 's accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
The loss is estimated at around € 400,000 .
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
The Chair@@ woman of the Lay Judge Senate , Judge Michaela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
It will be tried at a later date .
On the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
The sports officials had only offset expense allowances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 44@@ ,000 ) .
" At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , " said one of the defend@@ ents , who makes his living as an audit@@ or of large companies for the tax authorities .
With his colleague and co-@@ defendant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
With all the risks .
" We advanced money and depos@@ ited our life insurance policies with the bank as security , " he said during the examination .
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
Furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spective payment of the expense allowance back to 1991 was agreed .
As a result , a part of the expense allowance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
This is why general and not detailed debit entries appeared , was the former chairman 's explanation for the processes .
The two defendants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second defendant .
The Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail .
The club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120,000 was transferred into the club 's account .
Those were reserves , explained the defendant .
This securities account was run in the name of the two defendants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
" Why ? " the Judge wanted to know .
There was no answer to this for a long time .
Then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
Had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Prosecutor put to the room .
The co-@@ defendant knew about it , the official justified himself .
The purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
" Why compensation for damages ? " the Judge and the State Prosecutor wanted to know .
In response , the first defendant said that he had disagreed with this wor@@ ding because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
But what can I do when the lawyer says , " This lets us all off the hook " ?
" Am I a legal representative ? " he asked .
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary , he had only charged for mileage and a per di@@ em allowance .
The club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allowances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
The defendants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
This was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
The second defendant had also obtained a mileage allowance .
All adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in V@@ öl@@ ker@@ markt to the bank in Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hewle@@ tt Pack@@ ard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the splitting of the company .
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) .
As part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
This should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company disclosed on Tuesday .
The step will lead to a one-off charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
At the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 staff .
At the end of trading Hewlett-Packard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent .
The group based in Palo Alto , California , which initially grew through its prin@@ ter sales , is currently splitting its business : this year the computer and prin@@ ter side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
Both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
Re@@ pe@@ atedly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently aff@@ licted the world 's second-largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo .
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and pr@@ inters fell by 11.5 percent .
Revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive layoffs .
The 76@@ -year-old business headed by Meg Whitman has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smart@@ phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whitman 's plans for restructuring include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
Conf@@ lic@@ ts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
The majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
Six@@ ty-@@ one percent reacted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
Twenty-@@ four percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict .
Fif@@ ty-@@ one percent of those surveyed are against cooperating with the Syrian ruler Bash@@ ar al-Assad , but 20 percent were in favour .
Twenty-@@ nine percent were undecided .
Cars : Second press day at the 66@@ th IAA

R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on the Ser@@ bi@@ an-@@ Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cann@@ ons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspondent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke through the border .
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cann@@ on stood at the ready .
Between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles at the officers .
At first the officers used a continuous spray of pepper spray .
Then the police used tear gas .
A lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
This caused the group to break up .
The group has now reluc@@ tantly withdrawn .
A pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
Children who have inhal@@ ed tear gas are screaming .
Other refugees have slumped down together and are suffering from respiratory distress .
The press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.25 percent range .
It 's a historical event because it 's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , " said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trilli@@ ons of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
However the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy global outlook .
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
The decision is due to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was " sorry " for the first murder and wished he " could take it back , " authorities revealed Tuesday .
Police in Gau@@ tier , Mis@@ s. said Lam@@ b , a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University , called 911 around 10 a.@@ m .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
He said " I shot my wife last night " and also mentioned that there is a " sweet dog " in the house that is " not going to bother anyone " but is likely upset .
Police asked the caller his name , but he didn 't give it .
Lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : " I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn 't know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b allegedly believed Pr@@ ent@@ iss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday that there was " no information , no evidence " of a " love tri@@ angle . "
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was described as a " good person " by Shawn O '@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
The two divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was " devastated . "
He said Pr@@ ent@@ iss and her daughter were " absolutely best friends . "
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked an online job from her home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss by the Sun Herald .
Know@@ les said Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a ho@@ und dog named Lightning , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
" She always wanted to help other people , " Know@@ les said .
Police said Lam@@ b had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them " he 's not going to jail . "
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pulled his car over , bailed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university 's website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa re@@ construc@@ ting group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
The Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euro@@ s per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
Re@@ construction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots ' union .
Lufthansa is re@@ organising the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Euro@@ wings .
The goal of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
The Euro@@ wings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .

New negotiations with pilots
Following the strike which was halted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pilots ' union Cockpit ( VC ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
This was announced by the union .
Under discussion will be the pilots ' retirement scheme .
" In a year with record results predicted " Cockpit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
The conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
Besides the pilots ' transitional pension payments , the background is the " Wings " budget concept .
It proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa out@@ sources to the group 's own budget airline , Euro@@ wings .

Manchester United 's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United 's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven .
While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season .
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area .
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : " He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . "
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fanta@@ st@@ ically and then this happens .
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
He was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spo@@ t-@@ kick .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the referee , did not pen@@ alise the Mexican .
Van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A twe@@ et on Shaw 's account read : " Thank you everyone for your messages , words can 't describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . "

The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PSV coach , said : " It 's a very bad injury . "
If any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al 's Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
" He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it 's not good , " Co@@ c@@ u said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he [ Moreno ] touched it , but I couldn 't see the tackle on Luke .
Speaking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Moreno said : " I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
PSV 's Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
Surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
It 's one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child loves a book , it won 't be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
Asked by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his favourite kids ' book , the prime minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : " Fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it 's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . "
All very well , except that the subsequent par@@ agraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pr@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
" Set in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ drey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , " it reads , chronic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 .
If that wasn 't suspicious enough , Cameron 's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Movie Dat@@ ab@@ ase website , which begins : " In the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ drey . "
Given he is an avo@@ we@@ dly hands-on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ icious , tre@@ e-@@ ch@@ opping , th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ kn@@ itting On@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ on@@ ymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , mou@@ st@@ ach@@ io@@ ed creature who " speaks for the trees . "
Most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sourced to an aide , seemingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ ission but it 's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn 't rule out an away win , either .
Alastair Cook 's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mind@@ set is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a youthful pos@@ iti@@ vity .
With the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spinner and Adi@@ l Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
Related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex H@@ ales
The decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire .
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that crick@@ eters are judged on output .
There were no question marks over Joe Roo@@ t , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
A couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach , Trevor Bay@@ l@@ iss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
Only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
The only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly .
He is an X-@@ factor crick@@ eter , which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be aff@@ orded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE .
The idea of Mo@@ een opening the batting alongside Cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four qu@@ icks , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I don 't see why a stro@@ k@@ emaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a crick@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ cestershire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
He pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the squad as back@@ -up spinner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his raw stat@@ s - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ inners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Away from the squad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ rew@@ d additions to their coaching staff .
The appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri Lanka batsman , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stroke .
He is one of the game 's lo@@ vel@@ iest blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or coaching , and like Mah@@ ela has n@@ ous that can be tapped .
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fresh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly 's Durham team-mate Ben Stok@@ es is rested for the one-@@ day@@ ers , Roo@@ t was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree , the coaches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
Such decisions are never taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron 's half-@@ baked renegoti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of genial Jeremy " Is it Yes or No ? " Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
Fore@@ igners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nigel Far@@ ages too .
A European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sunk in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain 's self-@@ absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don 't want .
In Brighton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn 't want them either if they eroded social protection .
We could even call it Dave and George 's sel@@ fie agenda .
PM and chancellor rock up to sum@@ mits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ dee , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It 's all about me .
My European pal , who wants an out@@ ward-@@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - " Don 't leave us alone with France , " says Berlin - suggests that more short-@@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don 't care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany 's cautiously level@@ -@@ headed chancellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France 's François Holl@@ ande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017 .
He is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a national@@ istic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
It 's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fie Brits , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don 't want either because most have similar separatist tenden@@ cies .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , SN@@ P-@@ style , during the UK 's 2017 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my pal suggests .
" The renegoti@@ ation was a fix " and " Britain got nothing of value out of the renegoti@@ ation . "
The Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fleet Street can be and how EU-@@ scep@@ tic the o@@ lig@@ arch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Benn@@ -@@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They may di@@ mly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro-@@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an " EU straight ban@@ anas " Brussels correspondent in the early 90s .
For all his fool@@ ishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
They included the med@@ ley of tax-@@ shy ras@@ cals , phone-@@ hacking foreigners and p@@ se@@ ud@@ o non-@@ doms who own most of our great newspapers .
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you 're in a cage with a r@@ and@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ anas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
In fact Miliband was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron 's referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU 's abor@@ ted constitution , sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-@@ out card .
The press never for@@ gave him that either .
But nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting Neil Kin@@ nock 's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n 's official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evolving .
He says he 'd like us to stay in a re@@ formed EU .
Well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p 's wo@@ ad-@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of Tory little Eng@@ lan@@ der@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
It 's what Hilary " A Benn , but not a Benn@@ ite " Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n 's appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary 's struggle was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in " in all circumstances " - Benn 's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
Whatever the bott@@ om@@ -up , touch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of parano@@ ia and betrayal .
It 's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour 's support for granted in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Cor@@ by@@ n 's basic equi@@ voc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ ftw@@ ing dissidents for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squ@@ ab@@ bles .
As with his equi@@ voc@@ ation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that J@@ C won 't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be poin@@ tless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits " fe@@ eb@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
Experts critic@@ ise Public Health England e-@@ cigarettes review
Claims by a government-@@ funded agency that e-@@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in its report on e-@@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the " landmark " report last month , describing it as a " comprehensive review of the evidence . "
But several researchers have questioned the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the Lanc@@ et medical journal last month attacked the " extraordinarily flim@@ sy foundation " on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
Writing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were " built on rock or sand . "
Martin McK@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : " A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . "
They said the public would expect PH@@ E 's claims that " the current best estimate is that e-@@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking " would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
In fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) model to syn@@ thes@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different nic@@ o@@ tin@@ e-@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research paper .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study .
He also endorsed BA@@ T 's public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-@@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
The research paper produced by the group " tell@@ ingly concedes " there is a lack of " hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , " McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
However , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E 's claims that " there is no evidence so far that e-@@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smokers " were premature .
Prof Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being at PH@@ E , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
He said : " E-@@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . "
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the NHS £ 2bn a year .
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ cigarettes are not risk-@@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .
BBC should give up East@@ Enders , says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as East@@ Enders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would " give their right arm " for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals " biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BBC@@ 4 .
After the BBC 's director general , Tony Hall , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a ti@@ e-up with the BBC without success .
" I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed rivals , " Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you keep the licence fee , which I 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren 't making and commissioning .
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it 's ludic@@ rous , it 's obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : " I don 't see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
The Voice is one , East@@ Enders is another , ad@@ mittedly made in-house .
Frank@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it 's public service broadcasting .
I don 't think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings " because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . "
His comments about the BBC 's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as East@@ Enders .
Johnson said the BBC 's more niche public service programmes " go on to BBC@@ 4 where quite often you can 't measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about just@@ ifying £ 4@@ bn in licence fee income , " Well of course , we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched . "
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
On the licence fee , Johnson told the committee : " I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don 't consume a lot of the BBC .
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should revise its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to " inform , educate and entertain . "
He said little of the BBC 's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to " inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and entertain . "
On the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online .
'@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics ' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are blasted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
The tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are blasted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pitched for humans to hear .
The pul@@ ses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry membran@@ e channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
Related : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activ@@ ate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body .
Sre@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , a researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-@@ brain stim@@ ulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people 's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Nem@@ at@@ ode worms do not usually react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , amp@@ lify the ultras@@ onic waves which then pass inside the worms .
The amp@@ lified ultras@@ ound waves act on structures called TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels , found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms " cells .
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activ@@ ate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
To make ultras@@ o@@ und-@@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neur@@ ons carried TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels .
When he applied ultras@@ ound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were amp@@ lified by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they switched on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
The procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
But Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over that technique .
Unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ bre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
" We believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neur@@ ons temporarily susceptible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , " said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insu@@ lin@@ -@@ producing cells , he added .

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cro@@ pping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance .
" Important announcement , Trav@@ elling on the DL@@ R from 15th to 18th September ? " reads one , using London Underground fon@@ ts and branding with the DL@@ R line turning into the image of a tank .
This September , a s@@ warm of arms dealers will be desc@@ ending on the DL@@ R ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Desig@@ ns in Ban@@ ks@@ y 's Dis@@ mal@@ and .
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using " Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , " a £ 6 pack of Allen keys which it claims " gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet . "
Transport for London is not am@@ used by this fly@@ posting " vandalism . "
One of the spo@@ of ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective .
According to Gavin Grin@@ don , curator of Cru@@ el Desig@@ ns and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries .
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements , re@@ alising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .

The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency V@@ CC@@ P working pro bon@@ o , with the graphic designer and voic@@ eover artist also working for free .
V@@ CC@@ P creative director Matt Le@@ ver was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on Ex@@ Ce@@ L 's calendar - and thought : " Let 's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . "
They to@@ yed with creating a more realistic do@@ d@@ gy corporate advert , but " by r@@ amming it home with bright colours and animation , it was more arresting . "
" They 've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , " says Tom Davies at Amnesty .
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhib@@ itors flog fanta@@ st@@ ically euph@@ em@@ istic products .
In a press release , Saab revealed an order from the US army for " the shoul@@ der-@@ launched AT@@ 4@@ CS RS . "

Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It 's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obli@@ vious 19-year-old , still believing in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but it 's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .

Terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
Property entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ d@@ ner is building terr@@ aced houses in the Middle Fran@@ con@@ ian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
For example for refugees - but also as a sign : " Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . "
" I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well now@@ adays , " says the 44@@ -year-old in an interview .
Thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
Entreprene@@ ur Marcus Gil@@ d@@ ner believes he knows how quickly econom@@ ical housing can be developed : with this project he is building terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ d@@ ner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
What solution are you offering ?
Markus Gil@@ d@@ ner : Mass accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms is not sustainable .
Because most of the people will be staying here .
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influx of refugees over the next decades .
A totally standard three-@@ storey terr@@ aced house is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : A terr@@ aced house needs little space .
It facilit@@ ates integration .
It is different when the people are housed in blocks of flats .
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
Each living unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
It 's possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I 'm going back .
Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4,000 without land .
That is manage@@ able .
Construction took six months .
That is reasonable .
Did building regulations complic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
The sword of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
Sc@@ ary .
It is still assumed that anyone creating three flats in a terr@@ aced house needs at least three parking places .
Except that there is not enough space in towns .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How have residents reacted to your terr@@ aced house project ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : There were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
That is definitely not true .
But aren 't you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
My project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well now@@ adays .
This is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Sett@@ ings app , tapping " General , " and then selecting " Software Update . "
If it 's ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
Some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that " Software update failed . "
To get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and upgrade through iTunes .
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
That might include del@@ eting ap@@ ps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by s@@ lim@@ ming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest ap@@ ps to del@@ ete and then re-@@ install them once the process is over .
It 's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the update happens , so that it doesn 't run out of battery .
If the charge is too low , Apple won 't let the update go ahead , since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking .

Rosberg 's only motto : full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formula One world championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton : " Full attack . "
The world championship runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races " that I 've got nothing more to lose . "
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divide the vice world champion from the tit@@ le@@ holder and two times champion Hamilton .
The Brit has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the flood@@ lit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite .
In 2009 and in the preceding year the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race .
Whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear .
A p@@ all of smo@@ g has been hanging over the city for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra .
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The " Ch@@ ess friends of Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen " chess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
The new member is businessman Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen more than 40 times for spa treatments .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and is a fre@@ eman of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein .
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
Youth work and talent searches can also be pursued .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants his membership of the chess club as well as his friendly contact with the " Re@@ d-@@ white " tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town .
Ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ation office seeks face-to-face contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the man@@ tle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Plat@@ z .
In addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
The social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
More precisely , to Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Plat@@ z .
A new accommodation office will be opening there shortly .
Here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or the services of nursing and health insurance companies .
With our out@@ patient care service we have for years realised that family caregivers are often left alone .
This raises numerous questions .
" Not in@@ frequently , too , many services provided by insurers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , " the new manager , J@@ ut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people 's welfare is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft and the B@@ ü@@ r@@ ger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for " Ama@@ de@@ us " out@@ patient services , explained .
Apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and wellness .
Sal@@ u@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
As a result , additional offerings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapy treatment are also available .
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis represents prevention , precaution , and rehabilitation .
" The senior citizens ' centre for care and nursing , " is how Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis describes it .
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good dec@@ entr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
Furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . " There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend inv@@ itations to regular social gatherings . "
Thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
The accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.@@ m .

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl Man@@ g dies at the age of 92
Karl Man@@ g , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the K@@ ü@@ n@@ st@@ ler@@ haus on Tuesday .
In Men@@ g the K@@ ü@@ n@@ st@@ ler@@ haus has lost an hon@@ our@@ ary member and at the same time " one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , " it is reported .

Park@@ ing penalty : Tim Wiese throws money at traffic war@@ den
Ex-@@ footballer Tim Wiese attracts the wrong sort of attention in Bremen
He was once a footballer but now Tim Wiese , ex-@@ national goalie for Germany who also played for Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , is a wrest@@ ler .
According to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of muscle mass in the past two years .
On the other hand he hasn 't put on any intellectual weight .
Wiese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when outside he saw a traffic war@@ den putting a penalty notice on his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .
Wiese stormed out of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers , abused the officer and threw down the money for the fine at her feet , according to a report in the " Bild " newspaper .
The accusation has been confirmed by the town of Bremen but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be .
" The matter is still being investigated , " says a spokesperson for the town of Bremen .
Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wiese .

Men set upon 17-year-old Af@@ gan
Police are seeking witnesses to an incident in Bad So@@ den@@ -S@@ al@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster . At about 11.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster .
According to police one of the group , a 17-year-old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
At this point the group were level with the b@@ ft petrol station .
Three people were standing on the petrol station premises .
One of these men shouted at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist .
This broke the victim 's nose and his nose bled heavily .
One of his two friends ran to him and beg@@ ged the attacker to let the victim go .
The injured young man was taken home by his friends .
The perpet@@ rator followed the group to their home in a car and drove past it several times in an ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous manner .
As soon as they could no longer see the car , the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette .
There he was attacked again by his original attacker and another male .
Using a club , they beat the victim in the face and upper leg .
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
Up to now there is only a vague description of the perpetrators .
One was a man of about 5ft 11@@ in tall .
The second attacker was about 5ft 5@@ in tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt .
Police are asking any possible witnesses to contact them by telephone on 00@@ 49 6@@ 181 100 123 .
Dr Frank Müller takes over Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen practice and invest@@ s € 3@@ 10,000
Sylvia M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over practice from Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen .
The mayor of the joint community , Bernd Bor@@ mann , business sponsor U@@ ta S@@ eim@@ -@@ Schwartz and A@@ sen@@ dorf 's mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are delighted at this turn of events .
Many areas in the country have no doctor - A@@ sen@@ dorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen practice .
While Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen is retiring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich will spend the next few months working part-time with his successor .
Dr Müller re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St.-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ str@@ asse 6 .
When the Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the time were finishing their residen@@ cies in Ver@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
" It was always in the back of our minds that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers would fit into this practice well , " says Dr Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen and laughs .
" When we were ready , I simply called them up . "
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
" The proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , " says 39-year-old Müller .
" We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . "
He also sees being his own boss as a benefit .
And so it was agreed that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers would buy the house with the practice .
However in the meantime they are living in Bru@@ ch@@ h@@ aus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
Father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg und Ro@@ ten@@ burg .
He is currently working as a consultant in Sul@@ ingen , fur@@ thermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bru@@ ch@@ h@@ aus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss .
While surgeon Dr Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen worked as a general practiti@@ oner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( a specialist in internal medicine ) speci@@ alised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practitioners .
" So it 's out with the endo@@ scop@@ y , " says 38-year-old Sylvia M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long-term and stress EK@@ G@@ s and we need one more consulting room .
The IT system will also be completely renewed .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 50,000 as part of a funding programme from the county ( € 2,500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 12,@@ 500 ) .
" This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , " stressed the mayor of the joint community Bernd Bor@@ mann .
According to Sylvia M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , some 2,000 patients visit the Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
There is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen , the chem@@ ist will stay in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
If they hadn 't found any successor , it would have closed down .
Anyone visiting the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers ' surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assistants and the cleaner from the Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ aus@@ ens .
With their leaving , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
" We started with only two rooms , " remembers Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ eh@@ ausen with a grin .
After such a long time she feels a little w@@ ist@@ ful .
" But we 'll still be living in H@@ oh@@ en@@ moor and I 'm sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , " says the internal medicine specialist .
Her husband adds with a smile , " We 've got a 6000 m ² garden . "
" Up to now I haven 't done much gardening , that might change now . "
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy travelling .
Croatia : " We are letting the refugees through "
" Border control is being brought in now on our southern border too , " says Interior Minister Johanna Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Leit@@ ner .
In parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can " of course " do so .
The care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
It is equally clear " that obvious signals are needed , " says the minister .
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austri@@ an@@ -S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ian border either .
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a " corridor " - Slovenia has refused .
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees .
However , Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar in La@@ ib@@ ach did not see it in quite the same light .
The idea of corridors is " absolutely unacceptable , " Slo@@ v@@ ein@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , as the external border to the Sch@@ engen area , is however already heavily controlled .
But as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not suggesting se@@ aling its borders for refugees .
" Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , " stressed Gy@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar .
According to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the To@@ var@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize field .
Since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian Tav@@ ar@@ nik .
They are mostly Syrian and Afghans , among them many women and children .
The emergency se@@ vices and the Red Cross are also already in place .
Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days .
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ on@@ ian@@ -S@@ erb@@ ian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diverted to Croatia
The government in Belgrade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . " We neither can nor want to do that , " they stated .
According to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
Over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The detainees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Maced@@ onian border , about 500 kilometres away .
" We heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , " said one of the refugees .
They wanted to go through Croatia , Slo@@ wen@@ ia and Austria to get to Germany .
This implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predicted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : " Wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad options for border control "
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees .
He gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-@@ member of the Sch@@ engen Treaty , has " widespread options for border control . "
Rig@@ orous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Sche@@ gen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to media reports from Belgrade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
The Hungarian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border crossings also remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister , Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic , tried to reassure people : he considers the debate on the refugees ' alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be premature .
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
But private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ ef@@ ields .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers has been sent to the border region .
Stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukrain@@ ians pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok belonged to a ring of cyber criminals who since 2010 have repeatedly been accused of providing inside views of as yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Mark@@ et@@ wired and PR Newswire .
The information provided enabled insider dealing on the financial markets .
By this means , according to investigators , a total of over $ 100 million was sc@@ ammed .
" Current information indicates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught , " an SEC report states .
Proce@@ ed@@ ings against 32 other suspects in this case are continuing .

Ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care celebrates 20 years in Mann@@ heim
Business rules around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mann@@ heim
People carry out their err@@ ands , some of them walking b@@ risk@@ ly , some of them st@@ rolling along in a leis@@ urely fashion .
They head for the two branches of the Mann@@ heim car show@@ room .
Tr@@ ams stop .
Pul@@ sing , vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sunshine , and right in the middle are four big black@@ boards each bearing the words , " Before I die I want to ... "
The Ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is en@@ counter@@ ing extremely mixed reactions .
" It 's about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , " says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
The head of Ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .
While many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by impul@@ sively grab the chal@@ k and complete the sentence with " affir@@ m my life , " " be able to read , " " drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van , " " stop war " or " not suffer for long , " others stop briefly , read , say things like " I 'm not ready for that yet , " and carry on .
Again and again little discussions develop in corners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also there now .
" It 's only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live responsibly , " says the Director of the Protestant social charity Di@@ ak@@ on@@ is@@ chen Wer@@ k in Mann@@ heim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ itas Association for Ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care .
Which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20-year-old organisation .
Of course it 's understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it 's a very personal matter .
The topics of life and death are still steep@@ ed in tab@@ oos , according to Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer 's experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
A perception shared by Angelika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
The volunteer worker , who helps people to deal with death and grief , has been with the organisation from the start .
Having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
When the Ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation appealed for volunteer help@@ ers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the San@@ kt Vincent Hosp@@ ice .

FedEx earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
The company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
At this time last year , FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday 's opening bell .
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
Analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent , which will take effect Jan. 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was " performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er-@@ than-expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . "
The holi@@ day-@@ hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31 , FedEx earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
Revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
Six analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagn@@ ate .
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground .
In the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
In pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bell , FedEx shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.15 .
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-@@ foot Hon@@ dur@@ an mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table deciding if it 's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Lo@@ oming over them at one end of the central bank 's orn@@ ate , two-@@ story boardro@@ om will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair@@ woman Janet L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation 's economic interests above all others .
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
But since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there 's an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
And that third mandate could be the X-@@ factor in a too-@@ close@@ -to-@@ predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
Even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make al@@ read@@ y-@@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ itt@@ ish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
" Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , " said Lindsey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economist at brokerage firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus & Co .
" But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , " she said .
There 's no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market jit@@ ters .
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
Financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
" It would be a surprise if the Fed h@@ iked rates at this point in time , " he said .
If Fed policymakers did , " they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets ' hands so they don 't panic . "
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
Although job creation slowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
W@@ age gains have shown signs of picking up .
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
The economy " can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , " said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , chief economist at Pan@@ theon Mac@@ ro@@ economics .
But financial markets around the world started con@@ vul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
The market has rebounded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
For Fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
" Ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , " said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the UCLA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
Now , he predicts they 'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
" There 's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , " O@@ liner said .
The health of the global economy isn 't one of the Fed 's primary concerns , so technically it shouldn 't be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision-making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
The central bank 's influence in recent years has been enormous .
The mere hint by then-@@ Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might " t@@ aper " its monetary expansion triggered market con@@ vul@@ sions around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
Its decision-making process is " more art than science , " said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth@@ -@@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , Va . , noted this month that " the Fed has a history of over@@ reacting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundamentals . "
L@@ acker , a voting member of the policy@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 199@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings " despite limited identi@@ fi@@ able implications for U.S. growth , " L@@ acker said .
A year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England 's rat@@ e-@@ setting committee .
The latest turmoil doesn 't come close to that level , he said .
" You certainly don 't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , " said Po@@ sen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don 't think they should get ahead of the curve .

Hoy@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
These days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
To prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary help@@ ers .
In Hoy@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who un@@ sel@@ f@@ ishly support asylum seekers in the town .
Among these are Petra und Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a dedicated teacher .
Even at 74 she still loves teaching .
Every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on D@@ ill@@ inger Str@@ asse .
There she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil 's Pedi@@ atric Society of Rio Grande Promo@@ tes Healthy Bre@@ ast@@ feeding Die@@ ts
Brazilian pediatric organization SP@@ RS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breast@@ feeding , by featuring images of babies su@@ ck@@ ling from breasts painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy food .
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vit@@ amins , and car@@ bo@@ hydr@@ ates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system .
Due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
However , new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make .
A recent study conducted by Robert Wat@@ erland , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child 's immune system .
Ex@@ cep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
And it is making an exception .
The roof may be flat@@ ter to accommodate a solar energy system .
Planning for the long-awaited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
The committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an " exception , " or rather an " exemption " under building law to the applicable building plan .
The " exception " refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
According to this a " g@@ able roof with an off-@@ centre ridge and roof over@@ hang " will be constructed .
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . " This means we will have a wonder@@ fully large south-@@ facing roof , " explained mayor Josef St@@ ei@@ gen@@ berger at the meeting .
The " exemption " on the other hand refers to the roof pitch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stip@@ ulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
This will reduce the volume of the hall .
Therefore an " exemption " is necessary , since the development plan allows no " exceptions " with regard to roof pitch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemp@@ tions .
The sports hall is however more of a recurring project . " We are not setting a precedent with this , " says St@@ ei@@ gen@@ berger .
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bern@@ ried .
Costs have been calculated at around € 2.3 million .
Con@@ tribu@@ tions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
In the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
Pe@@ issen@@ berg Clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
The Pe@@ issen@@ berg Hospital is closing earlier than planned - in 2016 .
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au from Pe@@ issen@@ berg .
This allows for the district 's limited company hospital 's surprising plans , confirms district administrator Andrea Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss .
The Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pe@@ issen@@ berg will remain in employment .
The vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
The premises are available .
Those employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered positions in We@@ il@@ heim , according to Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss .
Employees have been informed about the plans .
The changes were triggered by the resignation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vic@@ inity of the hospital .
When the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss , the name of " Fischer , " who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au , was raised .
For the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital , these changes mean an " upgrade " and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss .
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pac@@ em@@ akers and defi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological disorders in its internal medicine department .
In the trans@@ ition@@ ary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establ@@ ishments , and in the next year the former miners ' hospital in Pe@@ issen@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
Thus far the district has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the We@@ il@@ heim hospital is finished .
District administrator Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradic@@ ts rumours that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Min@@ ers , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
" I can rule that out . " What will happen to the building , Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Weiss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
At the moment a Car@@ itas short-term care facility and a daytime psychiatric facility are housed there .
" It 's the best thing that could have happened for us ; we won 't get this sort of opportunity again , " says Fischer about the move to the Lech , which has been accepted " positively and with understanding " by employees .
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist .
He was asked by his colleagues at Sch@@ ong@@ au to take over the post of medical director .
The Pi@@ essen@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . De@@ part@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
The hand@@ ball@@ ers of Rhein@@ -@@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lö@@ wen are being challenged this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
The leaders of the Bundesliga are the clear favourites in W@@ upper@@ tal , however there are no grounds for arrogan@@ ce .
In the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at B@@ HC and they have some ground to make up there .
Two injured in hunting accident near P@@ rat@@ au
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday after@@ no@@ oon .
A number of hun@@ ts@@ men were in action on a corn field near P@@ rat@@ au ( Wit@@ ten@@ burg district ) during the harvest , according to police .
After shots were fired , two men , one 63 and the other 22 , suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital .
The precise cause of the accident was initially unclear .

Missing 16-year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
When questioned the 20-year-old admitted to having killed the teenager and thrown her body into a canal in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
Six@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old missing from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ en@@ hausen near Ka@@ is@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern the public prosecutor 's office and police reported on Wednesday .
A 20-year-old suspect , who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
The 16-year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
In their search for the young woman , investigators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
Interviews with the missing girl 's circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces ultimately resulted in 20-year-old becoming a suspect .
The presumed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ en@@ hausen , where the body was found .
Under interrogation the arrested man confessed the police that he had killed the 16-year-old and thrown her body in the canal .
The 20-year-old will be brought before the magist@@ rate on Wednesday ; investigators have reduced the charge to one of manslaughter .
Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Refu@@ ge@@ es need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
Pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The struggle for al@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ bur@@ dened .
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
To supply the demand for affordable homes , 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the " Social Housing " federation of associations .
In comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
This amounts to a shortfall of 140,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation .
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long queu@@ es in front of rental flats .
According to the German Federal Statist@@ ical Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as tenants .
The negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study points to significant failings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
There is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 77@@ 0,000 living units lam@@ ents Mat@@ th@@ ias G@@ ü@@ n@@ ther , author of the study .
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
Due to the slump in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in " Hotel M@@ ama . "
In large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time .
In order to solve the problem , the " Social Housing " alliance suggests a fresh start .
New incentives should revive social housing .
For example land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended .
In addition , according to the association , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary .
The K@@ f@@ W state bank 's refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
On Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 184 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been requested .
The project may now even be stepped up .
Refu@@ ge@@ es have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put corridor in place
Since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
However the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
" I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , " said Croatian Minister for the Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Sch@@ engen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Sch@@ engen country .
After the se@@ aling off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
Five hundred people came over the border at To@@ var@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had cord@@ oned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
Moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
The Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explains , " They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility . "
These people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighbour Croatia in the morning .
According to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They arrived at the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and in taxis .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
At the Croati@@ an@@ -S@@ erb@@ ian border the refugees did not come across border fences .
The border strips hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
It is now planned for min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers to quickly create a safe passage .
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up .
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,@@ 380 .
The new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences .
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
Those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extradition from the country .
According to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new " transition zone " set up at the border , almost all - 93 - at the biggest crossing at R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
In practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
According to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is " a safe third country . "
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there .
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by " the transition zone " in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Workers have begun to clean up in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
They are collecting the rubbish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
Crow@@ d barriers are being dismant@@ led and one of the reception centres in the border town is being rebuilt .
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
According to the go@@ ver@@ ment , around 20,000 migrants are still in the country .
In Salzburg , some 1,400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
In Fre@@ il@@ assing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drives " stranded people " over the border
" We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with suit@@ cases , " says Mayor of Wern@@ stein Alo@@ is Stadler .
Tour@@ ists who wanted to get to Pas@@ sau by train .
Because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in Wern@@ stein , " says Stadler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other help@@ ers and their cars chauff@@ eu@@ red the stranded people over the border to Pas@@ sau .
Before that we enter@@ tained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
We said at once that we would take them to Pas@@ sau by car .
" It was a matter of course for us , " says Stadler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
They were very grateful .
One man insisted on handing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire brigade .
" We were very pleased about that , " says Stadler .
The stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wel@@ s on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Pas@@ sau after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
But the regional train was stopped before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
In Wern@@ stein , ex@@ cur@@ sions over the border are generally very popular .
The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between Wern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bridge Festival Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bav@@ arian neighbours .
The fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypo@@ critical policies :
Instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke camp by construc@@ ting structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government 's stance closer to an atmosphere of national soci@@ alism .
It is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
Those who have fled , too , must notice that the " promised land " which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
It will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Kon@@ ra@@ d is looking for w@@ inter-@@ proof accommodation for 35,000
Kon@@ ra@@ d has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian Kon@@ ra@@ d is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
The government has engaged the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Kon@@ ra@@ d has already got to gri@@ ps with the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen reception centre .
" We no longer have any homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen , " he reported on his first achievement .
And the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great fuss , said Kon@@ ra@@ d , praising the organis@@ ational " master@@ piece . "
The Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a " critical situation . "
In total , Kon@@ ra@@ d estimates that accommodation for 8@@ 5,000 will be required in the current year .
In order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 35,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can manage .
" But it is not a bott@@ om@@ less pit , " says Kon@@ ra@@ d .
He has already carried out talks with the State Governors .
They have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
" It is going well in Austria , " says Ferry Maier .
The former VP mand@@ at@@ ary is assisting Kon@@ ra@@ d .
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch@@ ö@@ n@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
The asylum coordinator has also got high expectations of the ORF " Help the way we are " campaign .
Private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
It is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Kon@@ ra@@ d and Maier yesterday crit@@ is@@ ised the specific@@ ations for accommodation as " too high . "
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain heights for towel ra@@ ils or sizes of sky@@ lights .
" Emergency standards " should apply for a limited period .
Kon@@ ra@@ d uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells un@@ tru@@ ths to my face
His most important weapon is the power of persu@@ asion .
Kon@@ ra@@ d and Maier are not costing the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Kon@@ ra@@ d wanted to set up a container on Steph@@ an@@ sp@@ lat@@ z as an office .
But apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Lin@@ z demanding a better allocation
For the time being the city of Lin@@ z is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Ti@@ ps Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
At the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accommo@@ dated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( S@@ P ) .
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their suit@@ ability .
The town chief is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
Other districts should also make their own contributions .
Se@@ eho@@ fer : " Borders will not be cord@@ oned off "
In a long telephone call with Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eho@@ fer ( CSU ) , State Governor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Se@@ eho@@ fer has assured me that the German borders will not be cord@@ oned off .
The on@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
However appropriate border controls do now exist .
There will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany .
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
The fact that Austria is also now re@@ introducing controls at its borders is for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger " a logical consequence " of Germany 's approach .
The next Run@@ ta@@ stic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the " Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft " in the Lin@@ tz industrial area is officially finished .
The publicly listed IT group S & T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . It is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be rented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
" In IT clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to get them to work for us , " says S & T boss Hann@@ es Nieder@@ h@@ aus@@ er .
He can imagine investing in start-up businesses in Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft , and also later acquiring these .
S & T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours from the start - and Nieder@@ h@@ aus@@ er promises : " The next Run@@ ta@@ stic is only a matter of time . "
SM@@ T is investing € 1.7 million in the location and € 3.3 million is coming from Tech@@ centre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lin@@ tz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( F@@ FG ) .
The building is leased by Lin@@ z AG to S & T and Tech@@ centre for 60 years .
Thir@@ ty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already rented out and there have been en@@ quiries about the other 40 percent .
Ow@@ ner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni opens second business in the ar@@ cade .
In the new shop the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ ut@@ ta Bre@@ it actually wanted to get a dog .
The 49@@ -year-old propri@@ et@@ or of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade had to un@@ cerem@@ on@@ iously postpone this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she sells among other things bags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women 's hand@@ bags ; p@@ urses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
Lar@@ ger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
The new shop opened yesterday .
It has been converted over the last few weeks .
" I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , " says Bre@@ it .
Cru@@ cial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in B@@ olo@@ gn@@ a , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
" We are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , " said the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots .
Bre@@ it got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
It suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
Perhaps it 's because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any outfit .
The brag@@ gart from K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t
The Pal@@ at@@ ine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as brag@@ gar@@ ts .
This characteristic also connects many with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always the source of controversy .
Whether he is expressing x@@ en@@ ophob@@ ic opinions , being rude to journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a stir in the election campaign .
And comes out of it well .
This is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t , from where the property billionaire 's grandparents origin@@ ate .
The New Yorker with the b@@ low-@@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine route .
Many in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him .
His grandfather came from K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Trump , here in election campaign mode .
Simone Wen@@ del , a resident of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t , has made a film about Trump .
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
" I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t people they are not deeply impressed .
The native of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous off@@ shoots , included in whom besides Trump are also the Heinz ket@@ ch@@ up family .
Trump , who is not known for his mo@@ dest@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in " Kings of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t " ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t .
He has not won over the people there .
There is indeed a certain respect for his family 's achievements , but there also tends to be a view that Trump " is a bit of a big@@ mouth , " says Wen@@ del .
Co@@ inci@@ dentally , K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t 's nickname in the region is , " Die Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ mach@@ er , " a di@@ al@@ ect term which translates as " The Brag@@ gart , " she says .
Trump comes from the village of the brag@@ gar@@ ts .
The story of the Tru@@ mp@@ s ' success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald Trump 's grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a sal@@ oon for gold prospec@@ tors in the USA .
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
But his grandparents ' lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collapsed in the Bav@@ arian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then belonged .
They would not let Trump enter as he had originally left without author@@ isation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Cultural An@@ thropolog@@ y , Roland Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Trump is the grandson of " illegal emig@@ rants . "
This is at odds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his desc@@ end@@ ant .
He has repeatedly spoken in der@@ og@@ atory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
" The fuss he makes about it is not very nice , " says Hans-@@ Joachim Bender , a distant relative of Trump ( " My grandmother was born a Trump , my grandfather was born a Heinz " ) .
The retired win@@ emaker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , " he always has a short f@@ use . "
Does he think Trump will come ?
" I can 't imagine it , " says the 7@@ 2-year-old .
" He has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t . "
Gu@@ est house land@@ lady Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ram@@ m , like many of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t 's inhabitants , men@@ tions that desc@@ endants of the Heinz family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
" I can 't imagine Donald doing that , " says the 68@@ -year-old .
She would prefer it if he doesn 't win the election as " he has such radical opinions , I don 't know whether it would be a good thing . "
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grandfather 's time , " he would never have gone there . "
" There are more interesting topics than him , " says win@@ emaker 's daughter Sarah B@@ ü@@ h@@ ler .
And as president ?
" He 's certainly not my president , " she says .
And , " the grapes will ri@@ pen without President Trump . "
Wen@@ del 's film , for which Trump gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12,000 cinem@@ a-@@ goers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
The Upper Bav@@ arian district of Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ ch@@ t@@ es@@ gaden is Germany 's first " Mountain@@ eers ' Village . "
The village of 1,800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ ch@@ t@@ es@@ gaden National Park received the award for " Gent@@ le Tourism " from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ p@@ f@@ enn@@ ing , on Wednesday .
There are already 20 " Mountain@@ eers ' Vill@@ ages " in Austria .
In our neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the distinction .
A " Mountain@@ eers ' Village " is permitted to have a maximum of 2,500 residents .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
Seven 's Sun@@ rise dominates ratings , despite Nine 's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefan@@ ovic and Lisa Wilkinson 's dash to Can@@ ber@@ ra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today .
Nine 's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turn@@ bull 's overthrow of Tony Abbott .
Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , hosted by David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was stuck in London as part of a week-@@ long series of international tel@@ ec@@ asts which also include Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
That tyran@@ ny of distance didn 't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sun@@ rise averaging 39@@ 7,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today 's 3@@ 39@@ ,000 .
Today scored a slight up@@ tick compared to its ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) but its figure was behind last Thursday 's ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today has been closing the gap on Sun@@ rise in recent months .
In August , Today averaged 3@@ 18,000 to Sun@@ rise 's 3@@ 30,000 .
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , Sun@@ rise is averaging 3@@ 49@@ ,000 viewers to Today 's 3@@ 14,000 .
This is the most interesting thing that 's happened all morning .
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks !

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former P@@ acked to the Raf@@ ters star Erik Thomson .
The new drama , about a recently wid@@ owed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children , averaged a very impressive 1.@@ 219 million viewers .
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
Last night 's result answered that with a re@@ sounding " yes . "
Seven 's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers , easily beating The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Families ( 7@@ 26,000 ) .
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia .
The first half-hour ( 5@@ pm to 5.@@ 30pm ) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O '@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe averaged 4@@ 46@@ ,000 viewers .
The second half-hour ( 5.@@ 30pm to 6@@ pm ) jumped to 6@@ 23,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGu@@ ire 's Hot Seat ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
On Monday night , the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 5@@ 20,000 viewers and the second half-hour a wh@@ opping 7@@ 20,000 .

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
Secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons@@ -@@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski may have un@@ wit@@ tingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been sw@@ athed in ut@@ most secrecy .
And the three girls left standing certainly aren 't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose .
But when we checked in with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons@@ -@@ Fel@@ lows the day before three become two , they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be .
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday 's finale
All three women wa@@ xed ly@@ rical over why Wood is the perfect man , citing his sense of humour , ambition , family values and pos@@ iti@@ vity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
However when asked the question , " If not you , who should get Wood 's final rose ? , " their answers could have provided a spo@@ iler as to who won the Bachel@@ ors heart .
Both Je@@ av@@ ons@@ -@@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o@@ ski were quick to name Mack@@ ay as , apart from themselves , the best match for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rap@@ port since day one .
" From the moment I walked into the house , reading ( Sarah 's ) energy and Sam 's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , " said Je@@ av@@ ons@@ -@@ Fel@@ lows .
" Sarah is really down to earth , she 's so much fun to be around , " added Mark@@ o@@ ski .
I 've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there .
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
For her part , Mack@@ ay said last week 's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be " the one . "
" Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn 't just a game - I 'm whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ tedly invested in him now , " she said .
And asked who Wood should choose if not her , she was enig@@ matic .
" I don 't know if I can say , " she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it 's a tie between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
The Bachelor airs Wednesday , 7.@@ 30pm on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options of where to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
But Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tom@@ su@@ la and it 's looking like a wise decision .
Some coaches would have ben@@ ched Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday 's 20-@@ 3 win against Minnesota .
But Tom@@ su@@ la showed faith in his man , giving Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tom@@ su@@ la continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game .
Instead of che@@ wing out his rook@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ su@@ la also backed Hay@@ ne publicly in his post-@@ match press conference .
49ers beat reporter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordin@@ ator Thomas McG@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne f@@ umbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut .
Hay@@ ne was seen cur@@ sing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish & Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 he couldn 't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career .
" It was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that 's it , " said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne likened the bl@@ under to his Ori@@ gin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-@@ goal led to a Queensland try .
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

Because of the large number of refugees , the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bav@@ aria .
At the start of the F@@ W autumn conc@@ la@@ ve , party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bav@@ aria 's schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new schoolchildren : " We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collapsing , " said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
" Otherwise we will have up@@ heav@@ als in the Bav@@ arian education system . "
The Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler faction is in session in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian community until Friday .
Very different main topics were originally planned .
But the record number of refugees is dominating the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler meeting too .
" Of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ ve , " says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugosla@@ vian war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
" It can 't go on like this , we have to get to the causes , " says the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler head .
The Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler want to de@@ port failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
For this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ min@@ str@@ ative courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : " We need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , " says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
The F@@ W head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states : " We need unified standards in the Federal states nationwide . "
" Bav@@ aria de@@ ports ; others don 't . "
" We must be more efficient . "
However , regional politics in Gro@@ s@@ sw@@ ahl@@ st@@ ad@@ t should not be allowed to suffer .
An issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
In the new school year the Education Minister , Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CDU ) , started a " middle school plus " pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in gramm@@ ars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification exam .
But that is not enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
" The G@@ 9 issue must be spee@@ ded up , " says the F@@ W head .
We demand freedom of choice for all gramm@@ ar schools that want it .
A free move to G@@ 9 everywhere it is wanted .
Stron@@ ger Wall Street gives Dax a helping hand
After an over-@@ long stretch of aim@@ less and ed@@ gy trading , the German stock market has closed with gains .
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a clearer direction which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10,@@ 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
The value of M@@ Dax medium size companies gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19,@@ 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

The Euro@@ Stoxx 50 , the benchmark index in the Eurozone , moved ahead by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3,@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
The markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains .
In the USA the Dow Jones index closed at about 1 percent up .
Many brokers reck@@ on that markets will remain static until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also the major maturity of the futures exchanges this Friday .
Disc@@ ussion about the impact due to the ph@@ asing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed RWE stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on E@@ on .
According to the " Spiegel , " the German energy companies potentially lack € 30 billion in reserves .
The German Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
Stocks in the two largest German energy businesses have subsequently recovered somewhat , although ultimately RWE lost 3.@@ 31 percent and E@@ on 6.@@ 15 percent .
Infin@@ eon shares climbed to the top of the Dax by a further 3.@@ 22 percent .
In the view of one trader , a positive report by US investment magazine " Bar@@ ron 's " at the weekend continues to have an effect .
According to him investors in the German chip manufacturer are currently paying too little attention
Thus investment in the promising waf@@ er technology and a focus on the automotive market should pay off .
Car stocks were in demand : even in the traditionally week summer month of August , again more cars were sold than in the previous year period , as the manufacturers ' association Ac@@ ea disclosed at the start of the International A@@ o@@ tom@@ ob@@ ile Exhib@@ ition IAA in Frankfurt .
Stocks for car manufacturers Daimler and BMW , O@@ pel and Fiat gained by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Stocks on Volkswagen increased in price by 1.@@ 26 percent .
On the German bond market , the current yield of listed Federal Government securities fell by 0.@@ 48 percent ( on Friday 0.@@ 50 percent ) .
The Rex bond index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
Government futures lost 0.@@ 71 percent , going down to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
The rate of the Euro sank in the afternoon , ending at $ 1.@@ 12@@ 62 .
At around midday the European Central Bank had set the reference price at US $ 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .
This means that the dollar cost € 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) .
4 Killed After Police Fire Rub@@ ber Bul@@ lets at Protesters in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country 's proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pras@@ ad Dha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr. Dha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bullets .
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-@@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal 's southern plain@@ s , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilu@@ te their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Th@@ arus who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Aug .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal , which has been cent@@ rally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Lawmakers have been voting on cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday .
Con@@ tru@@ ction area planned in the town
The plot of land at the Al@@ te Post youth centre in Em@@ den is going to be built on again .
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square metre area .
A mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Al@@ te Post youth centre .
Pre@@ par@@ ations are currently underway .
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
A spokesperson for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers .
The identities of possible investors are not yet clear .
Con@@ sequently , no contract has yet been concluded .
The town of Em@@ den sold a part of the site , situated on the Ring@@ str@@ asse / corner of Gro@@ s@@ se Str@@ asse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demolished .
H@@ ie@@ ve project : facts are in the open
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kl@@ ein@@ es Me@@ er near Em@@ den are taking shape .
Investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
A number of residents are again concerned - they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge .
Plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and plo@@ tted behind closed doors for months .
Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ ein@@ es Me@@ er near Em@@ den are in the open .
The interested party , the Em@@ den company " System@@ -B@@ au , " presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
Origin@@ ally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
Under pressure from critics of the project and from the FD@@ P faction , who had accused investors and the administration of secre@@ tiveness , Ral@@ f Behr@@ ends of the System@@ -B@@ au management went on the offensive . " We don 't yet have an answer for all the questions , " he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spectators .
But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now .
The € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Roberto Schulz , property owner and member of the board of the residents ' lobby group , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , claims : " It 's going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings . "
Furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the facility . " We have to reck@@ on with whole bus@@ loads arriving , " said Schulz .
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hec@@ t@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
No operator has yet been identified .
" First of all we have to present a coherent concept , " says Ral@@ f Behr@@ ends .
Since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to variation .

Google launches don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ G@@ L.@@ O ) announced a don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-@@ torn and impoverished countries .
Google took an un@@ character@@ istically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog .
Rather than having an executive make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , " she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desperate for help .
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : Doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.5 million worth of donations globally at goo@@ gle@@ .com / refu@@ ge@@ er@@ el@@ ief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four@@ -year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fleeing war-@@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

For mil@@ dly obese diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
It 's still to early to say whether mil@@ dly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ surgical treatments , however .
" The mortality data take a long time to show up , " said Dr. Robin Blackstone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
Weight loss operations , or bar@@ i@@ atric surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , bar@@ i@@ atric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bid@@ ly obese , with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a@@ .gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , researchers from Taiwan 's Min@@ -Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bar@@ i@@ atric surgery - gast@@ ric bypass and sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mil@@ dly obese .
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , the BMI among those receiving non-@@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
Among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
In the medic@@ ally-@@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
In addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des , and " bad " LD@@ L cholesterol " was generally better in the surgical group , " the authors found .
The researchers also monitored patients ' blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
Hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better " gl@@ yc@@ emic control " - as reflected by the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr. Ch@@ ih@@ -@@ Ch@@ eng Hsu and colleagues .
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
At the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tomy group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in BMI ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.9 percent vs 16.@@ 7 percent ) .
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medic@@ ine-@@ Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , obese people who had bar@@ i@@ atric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
Though the new study didn 't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Blackstone said it 's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure .
" This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group , " with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient 's BMI falls between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , " she said .
I think that once they 've accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wired their bodies into obesity and diabetes , reversing that is really hard .

" It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe " - Dalai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees " home countries .
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
He claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
He also stressed that , however admir@@ able , the West-@@ European countries " response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
" It it 's impossible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
" So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , " he emphasized .
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We have to reduce the use of force .
The use of force has never solved these problems , " he added .
Ad@@ dressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush 's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US " violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
After 9 / 11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , " the Dalai Lama said .
Four@@ fold increase in children in@@ gest@@ ing hand san@@ iti@@ zer in last 4 years
Po@@ ison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-@@ percent up@@ tick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swal@@ lowing highly-@@ alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
According to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , hand san@@ iti@@ zer in@@ gest@@ ion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
" Kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there 's a percentage of them going to the emergency room , " Lopez told CNN .
He said some kids are drinking san@@ iti@@ zer intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or on a soci@@ al-@@ media dare .
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking san@@ iti@@ zer for a cheap buzz .
Te@@ ens have reportedly mixed san@@ iti@@ zer with alcohol@@ -@@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash for a sti@@ ffer drink .
Yo@@ unger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ iti@@ zer sc@@ ents .
" A kid is not thinking this is bad for them , " Lopez said .
A lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zers ) are the ones that are sc@@ ented .
There are stra@@ w@@ berry , gra@@ pe , orange@@ -@@ flavo@@ red hand san@@ iti@@ zers that are very appealing to kids .
Hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
In young children , especially , only a few squir@@ ts can cause alcohol poisoning .
" It 's highly concentrated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
So you wouldn 't leave a shot of whis@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ iti@@ zers out and if kids get into it , it 's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six@@ -year-old girl who recently in@@ gest@@ ed as many as four squir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry-@@ sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her blood-@@ alcohol level was .@@ 179 , twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children 's hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
" That was very scary , " Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah 's mother , told CNN .
It could have been very lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use n@@ onal@@ co@@ holic products or san@@ iti@@ zing wi@@ pes short of moving hand san@@ iti@@ zer out of a child 's reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some san@@ iti@@ zers have been linked to deaths .
In 2013 , two Ontario women died after swal@@ lowing hand san@@ iti@@ zer that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
Health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained me@@ thanol , a deadly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
In January , three fourth-@@ grade students in upstate New York plo@@ tted to poison their " mean " teacher " by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , " according to a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and banned it from her room .
Police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be " idle chat@@ ter , " referring discipline to the school district .

De Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : " In Holland , they don 't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why ? "
It is because Rangers aren 't there .
People here don 't only talk about Rangers coming back .

There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .

I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .

We really , really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better .
To stay together now is so important .

Why I 'm A Wit@@ ness At An Execu@@ tion In Oklahoma
Later today , barring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it won 't , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ sip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
The invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day approaches , I 've come to dre@@ ad it .
So why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
True , journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
Who@@ ever is picked will watch it disp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ sip 's closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-a-half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won 't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
Here 's the lesson .
Tell the inmate 's story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she " could have phr@@ ased it better , " but still thinks I 'm wrong to do what I 'm doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ sip has taken issue with some of the things I 've said and written .
He doesn 't tell me what to write , and I wouldn 't do it even if he did .
I 've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
If he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Huffington Post , will be alongside me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I 've made .
I won 't go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And it 's from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moody alleges ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his stab@@ les last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
He took aim at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria 's integrity department , alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lid@@ ari 's positive sw@@ ab to co@@ b@@ alt , which he can not explain .
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn 't want it " to look like sour grapes . "
" I wasn 't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , " Moody said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I 'm not that 's when I shouldn 't be a trainer .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
Earlier , Moody had dropped the bomb@@ shell in a rac@@ ing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
" Eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stab@@ les to offer information on what I was doing within my stab@@ les , " Moody said on Rac@@ ing.com .
They obviously believe I 'm a cheat .
If that 's the case surely they should all hand in their brie@@ fs because they 've been in@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
Should that make me think it 's becoming personal ?
Has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I that bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think I am .
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I 've got no doubt what I 'm saying now might make them think about that .
But I 've got to the point now where I don 't care and that sad@@ dens me .
That really sad@@ dens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I 've got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The trainer 's frustration levels have built with the long-running co@@ b@@ alt inquiry involving Lid@@ ari and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could " throw my licence across the table . "
Moody , best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the rac@@ e-@@ day treatment rule " ridiculous " after a mud or clay p@@ oul@@ tice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
It 's against the rules of racing .
I 've got to accept full responsibility for that , " he said .
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
It had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three-month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the p@@ oul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
It is a joke .
People making these rules know nothing about the horse .
" We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , " Moody said .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bell@@ amy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of his side 's tackling as " agenda setting " by the NR@@ L 's two premier@@ ship favourites .
Sydney Roo@@ sters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to " wrest@@ le " his side during the Storm 's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thin@@ ly ve@@ iled reference to the Storm after his side 's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a " showcase " of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren 't " too big " into wrestling .
Bell@@ amy defended his side 's tackling and said they just focused on their " contact " when tackling .
Bell@@ amy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them .
" That keeps coming up - I didn 't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-@@ 2 , " Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven 't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it 's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us .
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It 's funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy challenged Bennett 's idea of " exciting football " reminding his mentor that Bennett 's St Geor@@ ge-@@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the premier@@ ship in 2010 by playing " boring " football .
Wayne is talking about exciting foo@@ ty .
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , " Bell@@ amy said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn 't give a rat 's ar@@ se .
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foo@@ ty , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
That 's the foo@@ ty you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
He made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foo@@ ty - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that .
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
Six weeks ago they probably weren 't thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out the Storm and Roo@@ sters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game .
The Broncos game was probably a good game , I haven 't watched it yet but what was the score ? 16-@@ 12 ?
Our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foo@@ ty ?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
To me it 's agen@@ das .
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cron@@ ul@@ la Sharks in next Saturday night 's preliminary final at A@@ AMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .

Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic 's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was a flight risk .
He has clear connections to Serbia .
He travels to Serbia often , " he told the court on Wednesday .
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic 's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
" Having read the affida@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , " Judge Flan@@ agan said .
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and ad@@ heres to a 6@@ p@@ m-@@ 6@@ am curfew .
Acci@@ dent on the A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver 's cab torn apart
A lorry driver was seriously injured in a collision between three lor@@ ries on the A@@ 5 motorway near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
Two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked approaching long-term road@@ works in the direction of Basel .
The third driver noticed too late and tried unsuccessfully to s@@ wer@@ ve left at the last moment , according to police .
The cab of the driver responsible for the accident was completely torn apart .
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries .
The A@@ 5 between Bru@@ ch@@ s@@ al and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.@@ m .
Dam@@ ages amounted to € 12@@ 2,000 .
Ste@@ van Hog@@ g used girls phone to lure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
A pa@@ ed@@ ophile used an 11-year-old girl 's phone to solic@@ it child abuse images .
Ste@@ van Hog@@ g took the girl 's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hog@@ g 's hand .
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately al@@ erting her mother .
Police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered " concerning " web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children .
Hog@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would " lead pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es " on the internet before " pretending he was a police officer to scare them . "
Fiscal dep@@ ute E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court : " He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to sc@@ aring people .
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
He said he was doing it to lure them in .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
Ms Robertson added : " When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Hog@@ g , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year , breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
Defence solicitor Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was " no significant sexual element " to his crime .
Sheriff Alistair Car@@ mich@@ ael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports .
Hog@@ g was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date .
Traff@@ ickers move towards Germany over minor border crossings .
More and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German@@ -@@ Austrian border .
Due to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many traffickers are leaving
through minor borders on the Austrian side , says a spokesperson for the Federal police .
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Pas@@ sau and Ro@@ tt@@ al-@@ Inn since Tuesday .
They had arrived on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs on the German side .
They are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration .
According to reports from the Federal police , significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week .
By 8 a.m. about 700 people had arrived in the capital city of the state , said a spokesperson in the morning .
Following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German@@ -@@ Austrian borders , 1,7@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : tail end of tropical storm " Henry " expected in the south west
Meteor@@ ologists are warning of squ@@ alls in the south west from Wednesday evening on@@ wards .
Due to a depression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is flowing into the country , the German Meteor@@ ological service ( DW@@ D ) has advised .
The powerful trou@@ gh is the tail end of tropical storm " Henry , " which has moved over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the last few days .
Viol@@ ent storms and thunder@@ storms are anticipated , particularly in Baden .
According to DW@@ D , gu@@ sts of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour can be anticipated on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Mountains and in Bo@@ den@@ see@@ k@@ re@@ is .

The ch@@ assis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IAA
In 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
Comp@@ act class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( K@@ BA ) about 28.@@ 1 percent of new regist@@ rations in August alone belonged to this segment .
This is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
In among all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
One of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car sector here is the O@@ pel A@@ stra , which hits the car dealerships in the autumn .
" The A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , " said O@@ pel boss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas Neumann at the show .
It is at the heart of the brand .
To ensure that it sells well , the price of the new A@@ stra is not increasing significantly .
O@@ pel proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor , the VW Golf , which starts at € 17,@@ 650 .
The latest A@@ stra costs from € 16,@@ 9@@ 90 .
With a new 1.4 litre engine , the A@@ stra has an output of 74 kw / 100 h@@ p .
The H@@ essi@@ an manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 kw / 95 h@@ p to 147 kw / 200 h@@ p , including the first three cy@@ linder petrol model .
Unlike its most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the O@@ pel A@@ stra is only available as a five door .
In spring the estate car , already seen at the IAA , will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ stra at the IAA ?
Renault M@@ é@@ gan@@ e : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the A@@ stra , the M@@ é@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
The M@@ é@@ gan@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-@@ door , in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
It will be available in dealerships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
The Nissan off@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infin@@ iti , with its cur@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kw / 122 h@@ p .
A diesel with 80 kw / 109 h@@ p or 125 kw / 170 h@@ p is also on offer .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : also new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
On offer is the petrol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 litre tur@@ bo engine and a performance of 82 kw / 111 h@@ p .
According to the man@@ fac@@ turer 's specific@@ ations , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 Newton metres ( N@@ m ) .
The Bal@@ eno is launched in Europe in early 2016 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely re@@ designed , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IAA .
The designers at the class@@ y Citroën off@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator gr@@ ille has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology .
In the interior the in@@ fo@@ tainment system in particular has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple 's Car@@ Play has been incorporated .
In the compact class the IAA also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 308 .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five-@@ square-@@ metre cells are un@@ fit for human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has upheld a complaint by a former inmate of Te@@ gel prison that he had been housed for months in too small a cell .
In principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
The Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
According to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
For this reason a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . He was detained in Berlin Te@@ gel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
After@@ wards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of un@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
But the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and re@@ submitted the case there for renewed assessment .
In their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
The Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in custody are significant for compensation , entitlement to a claim for compensation exists .
Otherwise there would be " fears of deterioration of a person 's right to protection . "
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
As recently as April they awarded damages to a prisoner because he had been locked in his cell naked .
A cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also in@@ humane , according to a decision from 2011 .
Furthermore Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had at@@ tested to in@@ humane accommodation
The prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
Because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the tense situation .
According to information from the press office of the public prosecutor , 21 positions in Te@@ gel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : " We can handle it "
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What changes will we see in Germany ?
According to the predictions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . " I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . "
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
According to various forecasts between 350,000 ( estim@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400,000 ( estim@@ ation by the Pest@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 250,000 homes ) .
The lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 60,000 and 80,000 social dwell@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
In the view of the Pest@@ el Institute this is far too little : 80,000 social dwell@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.4 billion per year .
Academ@@ ics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
However the refugees in Germany are not being system@@ atically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , criticised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann Foundation .
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ esteem of the immigrant says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ä@@ n@@ hardt .
According to Thr@@ ä@@ n@@ hardt , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of dom@@ ic@@ ile .
As far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
One big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-@@ related language courses .
Studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
Thus , in Thr@@ ä@@ n@@ hardt 's view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
The Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kindergarten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . " For the upro@@ oted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , " says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Senate administration .
To be able to convince families of the benefits of kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issuing leaf@@ lets in a number of languages .
If the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical colleges .
In the states , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying - the only exception up to now was Berlin : Senator for the Interior Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has however now abandoned his stance .
Refu@@ ge@@ es who want to study may have their entrance to university facilit@@ ated .
Refu@@ ge@@ es with a residence permit or protection against deportation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
In principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
T@@ oler@@ ated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months .
But this financing gap must also be closed , claim Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin 's State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
The students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-@@ church law should be developed into a state-@@ religion relationship .
The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arrivals in a professional manner , is also important .
Rights also involve responsibilities .
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to concede certain control options .
This also requires the readiness to act cour@@ age@@ ously against religious fundament@@ alism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aim@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany " have immediately for@@ feit@@ ed their right to stay here in Germany , " he said on Bav@@ arian radio .
He suggested trans@@ lating this basic law into Arabic .
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
This means too that mainstream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
For nearly 10 years , as a result of European rulings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
But it is learning very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series shows , that racist motives are system@@ atically ignored in the police and the authorities .
Equ@@ al opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and non-@@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international tre@@ ati@@ es such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doctors ' Association , Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
" As far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we can cope , " he told the Tag@@ es@@ sp@@ iegel .
However extra money must be added to the system for this .
In order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Montgomery asked for all new arrivals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
Services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later .
And in the long term it is highly doubtful that so many people can be fo@@ b@@ bed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Benefits for Asyl@@ um See@@ kers Act provides .
Apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
Up to now , as Berlin health researcher The@@ a Bor@@ de has established , migrants have received poorer information about their illnesses than other patients .
Inter@@ pre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors ' practices , she demands .
But many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine dro@@ p-@@ in centres in emergency rooms .
And with a different diagnostic view .
Refu@@ gee children for example clearly suffer from more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Montgomery
" Par@@ as@@ ite infections or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recognise . " And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
To be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exams .
In the estim@@ ation of the Federal Psy@@ cho@@ therapeutic Association ( BP@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them are suffering from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refu@@ gee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the BP@@ t@@ K .
A so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumat@@ ised in Germany .
Those who suffer from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flash@@ backs , difficulties in breathing , dizz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , nerv@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
Up to now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
Ment@@ ally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
In addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This frequently leads to false assessments , says Mun@@ z .
The ring invites you to dream
With their new " Passion " production , Circ@@ us Pro@@ bst is returning to the traditions of the art of the circus .
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mes@@ mer@@ ising ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
Now Circ@@ us Pro@@ bst is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Zie@@ gel@@ w@@ asen .
" Our passion is our circus . "
" I couldn 't imagine living without my circus family , " says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and junior manager .
" Passion " - this is the motto for the current production in the ring .
The circus has been owned by the Pro@@ bst family for over 33 years .
The family has the gift of enth@@ r@@ alling people in their blood .
" It 's important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , " stresses the 27-year-old junior manager .
Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept a " Cock@@ tail in the ring with a cosm@@ opolit@@ an fla@@ ir . "
Fif@@ ty towns have the chance to experience this fla@@ ir on the almost 3000 kilomet@@ re-@@ long tour .
The circus programme wins people over with talented artists from all over the world .
Dist@@ ingu@@ ished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v c@@ lown family cap@@ tiv@@ ate the public with wit and charm .
The Castillo brothers , too , know their craft .
The Cuban duo are ready to compete with the heroes of silent films .
L@@ ight@@ ness and ag@@ ility - these words sum them up .
Their hum@@ orous arti@@ stry on the pole will win the women 's hearts .
Apart from causing numerous bursts of laughter , the Circ@@ us Pro@@ st 's ac@@ rob@@ ats are also mes@@ mer@@ ising with their fin@@ esse and sup@@ pl@@ eness .
Bal@@ ancing on a ball with a un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
No problem for He Yuan .
Con@@ tor@@ tion@@ ists enth@@ r@@ all and terri@@ fy at the same time .
Wang Lin , from China , is better acquain@@ ted with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics than most and thr@@ ills with his flexibility .
Six@@ ty enter@@ tainers from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
" The animals belong to our family , " insists Stap@@ han@@ ie 's mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
Differ@@ ent animal welfare organisations all too often complain about mistre@@ at@@ ment of circus animals .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst has her own answer to this : " If our animals aren 't happy , then nor are we . "
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every bit of attention .
The " four-@@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes " as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal doesn 't feel well , it doesn 't want to go in the ring either .
So the top priority is to look after the animals well .
The Pro@@ bst family are especially proud of their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id , J@@ umbo - the offspring of a Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony stal@@ lion and a z@@ eb@@ ra m@@ are .
The two animals lived together in one en@@ closure for eight years and nothing happened .
" Then suddenly there was our little J@@ umbo , " says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
But the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mas@@ cot for the Circ@@ us Pro@@ bst .
There is something for every visitor .
" One thing is for certain , " says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , " regardless of whether there are five or 1,200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
Circ@@ us Pro@@ bst invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.@@ m .
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.@@ m .
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
He was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
The opening of parliament was also tarn@@ ished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
Last month , they booed and h@@ eckl@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) chief whip Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt N@@ r Mugabe 's address .
" The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it 's titled ' death ' , " he told journalists after Mr Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
The chief whip said the party , led by Morgan Tsvangirai , is " worried " about the threats to its politicians .
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and co@@ st-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its fast@@ er-@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
" These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise , " said Meg Whitman , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
" Hewle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , " said Whitman .
As a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
Hewle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will have more than $ 50@@ bn in annual revenue and " will be focused on delivering un@@ rival@@ ed integrated technology solutions " to companies , according to a company statement .
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewle@@ tt and Dave Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed " the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . "
HP has been undergoing a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
The move by HP , the world 's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better .
Arsenal captain Mik@@ el Ar@@ te@@ ta says team-@@ mates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of Din@@ amo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
That best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer 's European Championship is clearly uncertain .
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharp@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
" This kind of injury is not career-@@ threatening , " said Wenger .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
It is nothing major .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
Research by Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ailments since he made his debut six years ago .
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games during the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
" Sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , " said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , Wenger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Mathieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Ar@@ te@@ ta are likely to start .
Wenger may also begin with Kier@@ an Gibbs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of N@@ ach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Walcott .
" I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , " said Wenger .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe 's most intimidating .
Din@@ amo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own " Inv@@ inci@@ ble " campaign last season .
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tre@@ mor that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season 's Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
" This drive is immense , " said Wenger .
It has never been done at Arsenal .
We were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ F@@ est : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is g@@ laring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high .
In 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in males than females .
In a bid to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friend@@ ship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-@@ school students displaying de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suff@@ er@@ er had a high enough percentage of " healthy mood " friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
Equ@@ ally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
But of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
In this age of soci@@ al-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often prior@@ it@@ ised over meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
This super@@ f@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner year@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
And as a billionaire video-@@ game creator explained recently , money really doesn 't buy greater happiness .
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
Each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
The humour of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ross 's p@@ ining for Rachel , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
As a Samar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : .... " my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . "
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
The old ad@@ age of " getting on with it " is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms .
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
As much as my objective , outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
And so , if you attend Comedy Central 's Friend@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
Or , better still , if in Starbucks you see someone alone , give a smile and say h@@ ello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ F@@ est
Di Maria scores to help PS@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after scoring against Mal@@ mo .
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PS@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
Here 's the match report and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint-@@ Ger@@ main began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des Princ@@ es on Tuesday .
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
With Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ ar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc 's side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic wast@@ eful in front of goal and later being sub@@ stit@@ uted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
" It 's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League , so to win 2-0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , " said Blanc .
It aug@@ urs well .
We wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Lig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argentina winger was lab@@ elled as the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti 's pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
However , if anyone then expected PS@@ G to ro@@ mp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick@@ -off and , with a five-@@ man defence and two deep in midfield , were stu@@ ffy opponents .
But , save for a Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Tra@@ pp 's far post in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PS@@ G let themselves down at times with some wast@@ eful passing and poor finishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
Nevertheless , he proved much more ade@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was tipped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ayan heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had fli@@ cked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell .
That ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wil@@ and from point-@@ blank range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach Age Ha@@ rei@@ de later admitted PS@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : " Our last Champions League game was in December last year . "
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
The qualifi@@ ers are not enough .
H@@ ats off to Paris .
It was a magnificent match from them .
Glen@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swis@@ s-@@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-@@ slashing plan .
Lond@@ on-@@ listed Glen@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
The company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grap@@ pling with tumbling commodity prices as China 's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
The rights issue sent Glen@@ core 's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
Shares jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 pence on the FTSE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.@@ 5-@@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4-@@ percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
It off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .
Refu@@ ge@@ es arrive in Wei@@ mar

White House Con@@ firms X@@ i Jin@@ ping 's Washington Visit
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , X@@ i 's first official one to Washington , will take place on Sept . 25 and re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama 's trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
" President X@@ i 's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President X@@ i to address areas of disagreement construc@@ tively , " the statement added .
X@@ i , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to bro@@ ach a range of contentious issues , including Washington 's concerns over China 's alleged cyber@@ espionage and its increasing asser@@ tiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

Xavi : Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 .
A few years ago , FC Bayern was apparently close to committing to Spain 's superstar Xavi , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
Eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - Xavi 's list of titles is breath@@ -@@ taking .
In the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-S@@ add Sport Club .
But in an interview with Mar@@ ca , Xavi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
" I was told that Bar@@ ç@@ a wanted to sell me . "
" At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren 't , " he says .
And FC Bayern noticed that too .
Xavi : " There was an offer from Bayern . "
" Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . "
A quick reminder : in the summer of 2008 , J@@ ü@@ r@@ gen Klin@@ s@@ mann took over at FC Bayern .
Guar@@ di@@ ola was the reason that Xavi did not transfer .
The transfer never happened .
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola .
Xavi explains why . " Bar@@ ç@@ a had signed on Guar@@ di@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Championship . "
" Pep@@ e told me that I shouldn 't transfer , that he couldn 't imagine the team without me . "
" He got me with that . "
Who knows how Bayern 's 2008 / 2009 season would have turned out if Xavi had left .
Xavi covered the entire distance on the turf for Bar@@ ç@@ a in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern , knocked the Reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph .
Matt Damon down@@ plays diversity in film@@ making
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn 't needed behind the scenes .
During Sunday night 's episode of HBO 's Project Green@@ light , the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was empha@@ sizing the need for alternative per@@ spectives regarding a black pro@@ tagon@@ ist in the project 's chosen screenplay .
" When we 're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , " Damon asserted .
Sho@@ cked , Brown reacted with offended disbelief , letting out " Ho@@ o ! Wow . Okay , " as The Mar@@ tian actor 's comments settled in the air .
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ leck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show 's finalists .
" I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they 're going to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , " Brown initially said .
The only black character who 's a hoo@@ ker who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angel@@ os and Kristen Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Damon re@@ tor@@ ted their directing could " end up giving us something we don 't want . "
After the discussion aired , social media exploded in disap@@ pro@@ val over Damon 's comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the clip writing , " Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is S@@ O WH@@ ITE it hurts . "
The twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
Damon 's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Lives Mat@@ ter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discrimin@@ atory practices against people of color .
In February , singer Prince allu@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards .
" Alb@@ ums still matter , " he said .
Like books and black lives , albums still matter .
More recently , leaders of the Black Lives Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck 's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
" The Black Lives Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , " leaders said .
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church 's portrayal in the West .
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .
'@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior ' crow@@ ns first champion
Pro-@@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
The competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
During the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and camer@@ aman Geoff Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
The final task involved climbing a 75-@@ foot rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior 's gru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
" I mean it 's amazing to think about , like I 've never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , " Isaac told E ! of his serious pay-@@ bump .
So to all of a sudden ... like I can 't even imagine what it 's going to be like ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever competitor to finish the course , won 't be awarded any prize money .
By the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
" If there 's more than one fin@@ isher , the one with the fastest time gets it , " said We@@ ed .
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great grati@@ fication .
I don 't think he har@@ bors any ill will about it .
He 's just so happy to have done what he 's done .
He 's received tons of acc@@ ol@@ ades from fans .
He 's such a great guy , and a family man .
He 's a hero to his kids and his wife .
Geoff said to me , " If I was going to be beat by someone , I 'm glad it 's Isaac . "
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin filming in Spring 2016 .
Detroit Tigers tip@@ toe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn 't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers .
Once one of the best teams in baseball , the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central .
Reduc@@ ing to being a spo@@ iler , the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday , beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field .
The Twins squander@@ ed a chance to climb to within one-@@ half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot .
For Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-@@ letter F-@@ word that has been so elusive over much of the season 's second half .
" All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , " Tigers manager Brad Aus@@ mus said .
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then t@@ acked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-@@ 9 ) pitched 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings .
" I just want to finish strong this year , " Simon said .
It 's hard for the bullpen to throw every game , and that 's why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first RBIs since mid-@@ August .
It was Martinez 's first three-@@ hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
" He swung the bat well , " Aus@@ mus said .
He looked good in ( batting practice ) , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
Tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fielder Byron Bu@@ xton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single , and Simon got second baseman Brian Do@@ zier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Bla@@ ine Hardy .
Hardy walked M@@ auer , the only man he faced , ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel San@@ o , who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew Ver@@ Hagen .
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second , Ver@@ Hagen got third baseman Trevor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to ground into a double play .
It was the maj@@ or-@@ le@@ ague-@@ leading 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit into a DP .
After Detroit t@@ acked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , M@@ auer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Ron@@ don to make it 5-4 .
However , the right-hander struck out San@@ o on three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit took advantage of a ru@@ sty Phil Hughes in the early going .
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation .
" Obviously not the start I 'd like to have , " Hughes said , " but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . "
After getting the leadoff batter in the first , H@@ ushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kin@@ sler .
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez , who singled up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-@@ for-@@ 21 streak with runners in scoring position .
Third baseman Nick Ca@@ stell@@ an@@ os followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
The Tigers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony G@@ ose to make it 3-0 .
" That was a big hit , " Twins manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
He didn 't hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hughes , who was on a pitch count , pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-@@ handed reliever A.@@ J. A@@ ch@@ ter .
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
NO@@ TE@@ S : Tigers R@@ HP An@@ ib@@ al Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder .
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews , who performed surgery on Sanchez 's shoulder back in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
With Sanchez out , L@@ HP Daniel Norris will come off the D@@ L to start against the Twins .
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right obli@@ que .
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday .
Norris ( 2-2 , 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will oppose Minnesota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Santana ( 5-4 , 4.@@ 73 ERA ) .
Hundreds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
The people who have travelled there will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden , according to a statement made by the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
They estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
A number of sports halls in the H@@ essi@@ an capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the last few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
After this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
According to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ essen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone
Due to the large number of refugees , emergency shelter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
I@@ sch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang I@@ sch@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
" I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , " he said .
He accused the European nations of " collectively looking the other way . "
Four years ago one would have been happy for the chal@@ ice of military involvement to pass Germany by .
" Now the conflict has come crashing down at our front door , " he said on the German World Service .
The former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Leit@@ ner , stated on the Austrian television channel ORF on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
" No , that is the agreement , " she confirmed .
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Leit@@ ner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route .
Most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Fay@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory re@@ distribution of a further 120,000 refugees .
In view of the heavy influx of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
The Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor 's office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
But those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany .
This opinion is also clearly generally shared .
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a " huge effort . "
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route .
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a fence .
Unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary 's Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to about the planned new border fences .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
The first arrests of people who had breached the fence have taken place .
In Turkey meanwhile , according to eye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .
" Cass@@ ini " space probe finds ocean on Saturn 's moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
Under the icy cr@@ ust of Saturn 's moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ lashes a global ocean .
Scientists have deduc@@ ed this from observing the " Cass@@ ini " space probe
This is the reason the moon wob@@ bles slightly in its orbit of the ring@@ ed planet .
This wob@@ bling is only minor , but nevertheless too much for a solid cel@@ est@@ ial body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Cornell University in I@@ th@@ ica in the US state of New York .
The scientists have published their findings in the " I@@ car@@ us " scientific journal .
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us 's cr@@ ust of ice .
" Cass@@ ini " had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes , which spe@@ w water v@@ ap@@ our and ice particles that feed the so-called E ring of Saturn , at the south pole of this moon in 2006 .
Ast@@ on@@ omers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the south pole .
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama absent from 18@@ 60 Munich for several weeks
18@@ 60 Munich must do without attacking midfielder Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
An examination revealed that the 27-year-old has suffered an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week .
According to the Munich Lions , the diagnosis means " probably a four week compulsory break . "
" It 's hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bitter loss . "
" We have to think about it of course , " Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ü@@ n told the " Bild " newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
However the next training guest the sex@@ agen@@ arian is due to present is a defender .
Thirty-@@ year-old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to V@@ f@@ L Wolf@@ sburg .

O@@ ko@@ tie sustained a head injury in a violent collision in the match with Fortun@@ a Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
Contr@@ ary to initial fears , however , the wound was not serious .
Not a diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ goes are exotic , ju@@ icy and sweet .
But anybody watching their wa@@ ist@@ line should avoid them .
Because man@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content - primarily su@@ cro@@ se .
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vit@@ amins as well as vit@@ amins E and C. But most of all man@@ goes are full of vitamin A and its pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or , be@@ ta-@@ car@@ o@@ tene .
E@@ ating the fruit boosts the sight , immune system and the body 's met@@ abolic processes .
When buying man@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant ar@@ oma .
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ripe the fruit is - even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
They should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
They are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes .
A man@@ go also gives a special touch even to sa@@ vo@@ ury dishes .
They mitigate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and radic@@ chio .
And a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

The fo@@ eh@@ n will then blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n V@@ alleys until Thursday morning with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the can@@ ton of Ur@@ i , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
In places the fo@@ eh@@ n may advance into the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains g@@ ale force winds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
While in the north stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ ns on Wednesday will bring sum@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moist@@ ure will begin to build up on the southern slopes of the Al@@ ps .
Here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening .
Over the next 48 hours the south of the Al@@ ps can expect over 100 lit@@ res of rain per square metre in places , following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days .
On Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n will die down , resulting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes thunder@@ y rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland .
In conjunction with the cold front , the wind will get stronger increasing to stor@@ my , and temperatures will decrease sharply .
The following days will be au@@ tum@@ nal in the north with temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sun@@ nier and warmer at the weekend with temperatures up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Some 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome now has a Martin Luther Square .
In the presence of the Mayor of the City , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hi@@ ther@@ to unnamed square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was on Wednesday best@@ owed with the name of the German re@@ former .
On the " Pi@@ azza Martin Lut@@ re@@ o " he is now recognised as the " German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation . "
The park is in the centre of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um
The consortium of Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protest@@ ants in the Pope 's city often had to hide their faith .
The square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
As a young Augu@@ stin@@ ian monk , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
At the time he considered the city to be a de@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
According to historians , his negative impres@@ sions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Luther heralded the beginning of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the selling of indul@@ gen@@ ces .
Tal@@ ented artist invest@@ s three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible .
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t Bible , which has now been issued with magnificent pictures .
For O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t , who has devised his own personal interpretation of bib@@ lical stories in 150 mo@@ ti@@ fs on paper and canvas , in the beginning was the picture .
The 75@@ -year-old conceived his " language " with bright colours and imagin@@ ative forms - which are however by no means synon@@ ymous with " funny " pictures .
On the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly gloomy .
O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a subj@@ ective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the " Book of books . "
Cy@@ cles evolved , dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross , pl@@ agues , the Command@@ ments or the Lord 's Pra@@ yer .
Without even approaching them , he immediately att@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Luther Ver@@ lag , a publisher speci@@ alising in the@@ ological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler Ver@@ lag , who focus on publishing art books .
And in particular author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has grap@@ pled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings .
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t and " translated " them to the current day , in a top@@ ical context .
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ t 's paintings .
They are embedded between the original Bible quo@@ tations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist , who has here form@@ ulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
The decorated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
The 75@@ -year-old allows at the same time a tw@@ of@@ old insight , deep into both his soul and his emotions .
This is particularly intimate .
Ultimately , his emotions were the key trigger for the Bible project : O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t , who was born in Wern@@ ig@@ erode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hut order .
" Education there took place under the shadow of the cane , " remembers O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t .
" I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : " The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
Sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ ism has been driven out .
Artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
Pictures always have something mysterious about them ; they are not dec@@ oration .
" In this respect , I am a dinosaur . "
O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t wants his viewers to let themselves " fall into " the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : " The picture is looking for its counterpart . "
At the launch of the O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t Bible on Tuesday , Klaus Al@@ te@@ post confessed to having " always " been a lover of O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t 's art : " I like the way he sees life with his pictures . "
Al@@ t was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible , selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious .
" This wasn 't a collaboration between partners , " says Al@@ te@@ post , " it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . " The result is a picture Bible .
For Hans M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler of the Luther Ver@@ lag this work is an invitation " to add depth to his life and to find freedom . "
O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t 's pictures speak , for M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler , the ( bib@@ lical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
Some of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the O@@ tm@@ ar Al@@ t Foundation .
Start of construction draws closer for BM@@ X track
Plans made , site found , company commissioned , mound for a circuit mod@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
Political and administrative failings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
So the mound was demolished and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
Appro@@ val will be received in October , chief local councillor Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach-@@ Bo@@ ch has now been able to inform the children 's and young people 's committee .
" I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , " she said .
The work should then be started without any " further pause for thought " at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football league gave clear indications at the weekend that the DF@@ B is extending its commitment to refugees to 20@@ 19 .
Football has reacted to the deteriorating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
" I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . "
" Basically nobody knows , it 's no concern of mine , it 's not my doing . "
" It is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue , " says DF@@ B chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I 'm going to be in the Chancellor 's office next Wednesday and I 'm meeting there with State Minister Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . "
" I 'm sure the topic will play a central role there , " he announces .
Football can and will help .
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative " 1 : 0 for a welcome " to four years .
" Through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us-@@ Braun foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , " declared N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach on the brink of the UEFA meeting in St Julian 's , Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme .
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words " We are helping - # refu@@ ge@@ es@@ welcome " on the left sle@@ eve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor 's logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
" We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , " Le@@ ver@@ k@@ usen 's sport boss Rudi V@@ öl@@ ler told the " Bild " newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as " a matter of course . "
" The refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . "
" We football teams can , no , we must use our charis@@ ma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , " says Hertha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim 's Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ti@@ g spoke of a prominent signal by the league .
The women 's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Sa@@ ale ) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hungary .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach describes supporting the refugees as " a grand joint effort by German football . "
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
The message " 1 : 0 for a welcome , " that we have sent out is being lived in football .
" That is of enormous significance , " he said .
In both this year and next year the association together with the DF@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300,000 available for the integration of refugees .
" The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , " reports N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
Reports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
According to several reports , the chief executive of Europe 's largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Dermo@@ tt , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
In an accident on the stairs in his brother 's house in the USA after midnight , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the " Wir@@ t@@ sch@@ af@@ ts@@ wo@@ che " on Wednesday .
" He almost bled to death , he was unconscious , then he dragged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , " the " Wi@@ W@@ o " quoted SAP co-founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
Mc@@ Dermo@@ tt will however be able to return to work .
" We are meeting up at the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf at the beginning of October , " said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
The 54@@ -year-old manager will be at the meeting and " fully fit for work . "
Mc@@ Dermo@@ tt announced in an interview with the " S@@ ü@@ d@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ en Zeitung " ( Thursday 's edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
" I am definitely there for SAP , completely involved in my job . "
" I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , the whole time , " Mc@@ Dermo@@ tt told the " SZ . "
Mc@@ Dermo@@ tt normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
I@@ i is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the " SZ " : " It could happen to anyone . "
" The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . "
McLaren reserve driver Magn@@ us@@ sen out of action ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twit@@ tered a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike .
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers , Fernando Alonso and Jen@@ son Button , for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as slim as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later .
Football : B@@ V@@ B v Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar without Re@@ us : Weiden@@ f@@ eller in goal
All hopes have been crushed for Bor@@ ussi@@ a D@@ ort@@ mund that Marco Re@@ us might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league .
The international player will also be missing from the German Bundesliga leader 's match in its dual with F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
" Unfortunately he isn 't in the running , " said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
The B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether Re@@ us will be there on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Le@@ ver@@ k@@ usen : " We are expecting him to return to training on Friday . "
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Re@@ us 's position .
So he has announced a change of goalkeeper .
Thus Roman Weiden@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of regular keeper Roman B@@ ü@@ r@@ ki .
" He 's training at absolute top level , " praised the world champion 's football coach .
Tu@@ ch@@ el is leaving it open as to whether Weiden@@ fel@@ der will be used in all European league matches in the future .
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
Mid@@ fielder Julian Wei@@ gl considers team mate Re@@ us 's brisk statement that the final of the European league must be B@@ V@@ B 's objective quite understandable : " Marco isn 't so far off the mark with that . "
" I think we 've got a good chance of picking up the title . "
Ro@@ bot cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
On Wednesday the German cabinet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( CSU ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the brink of the IAA motor show , about a " new era of mobility . "
Autom@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ ams , said Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt .
He wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IAA .
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
There is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 motorway to try out the new technology .
In order that " no extra liability risk will be imposed " on drivers , the government wants to " examine and , where necessary , adapt " legal parame@@ ters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ ver@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
With automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
However dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles " are not anticipated until 2020 " on public roads .
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.4 billion for 2025 .
" Digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , " says SPD transport politician S@@ ö@@ r@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
However the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers ' personal data must be conc@@ lu@@ sively clar@@ ified .
And Germans still view dri@@ ver@@ less cars scep@@ tically - much more than the French or Americans .
A survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation De@@ k@@ ra , presented to the IAA on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that auton@@ om@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see auton@@ om@@ ously driven cars by 2025 and in the USA 33 percent .
Anyway drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
According to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
Nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motor@@ ways in free-@@ flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ ams .
Approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
Boll not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
As things stand , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf player plans to play only in the singles in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision will be made on 22 September .
" It is a major loss for our team . "
" The lads heard about it this morning . "
" But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo , " said national coach J@@ ö@@ r@@ g Ros@@ sk@@ op@@ f during European Championship training in Dus@@ sel@@ dorf .
At this time Boll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China .
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday .
" Without Timo we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favourites , " declared individual European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov .
But the Ham@@ elin player , who is the top seed in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembers the European Championship in Sch@@ we@@ ch@@ at in 2013 .
" We didn 't have Timo then either , and we still became European Champions . "
" That is what we need to focus on , " declared the world number five .
The English football national player Luke Shaw , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
In the course of the tackle in the Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven , the defender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after a long bout of treatment was replaced .
Initial diagnosis indicates that the 20-year-old who used to play with Bastian Schweinsteiger has broken his ti@@ bia .
Gaul@@ tier feels too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works chamber of hor@@ rors : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday .
The highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look alarm@@ ingly human thanks to video projection .
They wear the French designer 's spectacular cre@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna 's stage outfits - and also put men in skirts .
" These days I can 't say I 'm the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te c@@ outure any longer , because I have white hair . "
" It used to be ble@@ ached , now@@ adays it 's real , " says Gaul@@ tier .
For visitors to the exhibition , " From the Side@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk , " which can be seen in the K@@ uns@@ th@@ alle at the Hyp@@ o Culture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character .
Origin@@ ally he was against it because , " For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , " he said .
When you die , you get put into a museum .
This remarkable collection has already been staged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
It 's about a lot more than beautiful clothes , " says the director of the K@@ uns@@ th@@ alle , Roger D@@ ie@@ der@@ en .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits provide an insight into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
The show is not constructed chron@@ ologically , but it is a brilliantly choreograph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins ' hair .
According to curator Thier@@ ry-@@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the creators car@@ ted 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
Shortly before the start of Oktoberfest there was also a special treat in store : a Le@@ der@@ hosen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna
He has always been interested in strong women ( " Women are clever@@ er than men " ) and in people who are a little different , says Gaul@@ tier .
Even Gaul@@ tier 's old te@@ ddy is on show in the exhibition .
He represents the designer 's first , tentative steps at fashion .
As a child ( he was not a good pupil and he was bad at football ) , he dressed his te@@ ddy in bras and dresses .
His parents did not allow him to play with dolls .
Later he taught himself fashion design .
He stole fashion magazines and scrutin@@ ised other designers ' cre@@ ations , Gaul@@ tier told us in Munich .
Of course , later I bought them .
He was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Dec@@ oration instead of cur@@ tains - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
There used to be long embro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en making many metres
of embro@@ i@@ dered fabri@@ cs and l@@ aces in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and cur@@ tains .
This is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ des@@ p@@ itz@@ e P@@ lau@@ en .
Instead , fashion is once more important .
In the early days of P@@ lau@@ en lace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home tex@@ tile industry - and now it is being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt gave a few examples : lace in dec@@ oration , for accessories such as bags and for traditional costumes .
Generally , so-called vintage fashion , based on style er@@ as from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
Anyone in the tex@@ tile industry in Germany who cannot serve a niche is no longer in the market .
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Mo@@ des@@ p@@ itz@@ e P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Sp@@ itz@@ e und Sti@@ cker@@ ei@@ en trade association .
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
There are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or wholes@@ alers .
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
Now@@ adays mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheap@@ ly in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
Furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly .
This is enough reason for new directions .
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness , as Cord@@ elia Bauer of Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein explains . " As of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ ologically and socially compatible .
Rein@@ hardt added , " This also applies to the materials we use . "
Quali@@ fied designer Ute Schmidt teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the Schnee@@ berg branch of the West Sax@@ ony University of Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au and speci@@ alises in embro@@ i@@ der@@ y and lace .
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is a field of tension between the designers ' newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , " says Schmidt .
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
A few years ago tex@@ tile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ vit@@ alised the historic snow@@ ball lace .
The machines embro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in selected places .
P@@ lau@@ en master gol@@ d@@ smith Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach@@ -K@@ rau@@ ß@@ e was inspired by this . " In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . "
Now she uses the snow@@ ball lace for her jewellery .
Using an elaborate process she em@@ bosses the pattern in silver .
" Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , " says Re@@ uter .
She also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose fore@@ fathers lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
So with my jewellery I see myself as a modern ambassador for P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new " Mary P@@ opp@@ ins " film
You shouldn 't interfere with legen@@ ds , but Disney is daring to make a new film of the classic " Mary P@@ opp@@ ins " anyway .
But according to " Entertainment Weekly " it is not going to be a remake but a sort of sequel , set 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny .
It is about the nanny 's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
Who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews , is not yet certain .
But the director has been decided : Rob Marshall , whose most recent film was " Into the Woods . "
X@@ i urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday .
" China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve open@@ ing-@@ up policies , " he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deep@@ ening Overall Reform .
Promo@@ ting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new imp@@ etus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , rela@@ x@@ ation of bor@@ der-@@ control policies , encouraging state-owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital and over@@ hauling the resident registration system .
According to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ locating resources , ensuring a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
In a bid to open up state-@@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
" The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
In addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or " green card , " by optim@@ izing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
Guaran@@ te@@ eing lawyers ' right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ iang , and senior leaders Liu Yun@@ shan and Zhang Ga@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neuro@@ tox@@ in .
The consumer organisation Food@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . " Ris@@ ks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children , " declared Mat@@ th@@ ias Wolf@@ schmidt of Food@@ watch .
According to Wolf@@ schmidt , the limits for the neuro@@ tox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shark or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish for " economic reasons . "
Large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mercury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
Once the limit has been doubled , however , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ eable .
In return for this rela@@ x@@ ation the EU , according to Food@@ watch , wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
But Food@@ watch describes this as a " trick , " because smaller prey fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already comp@@ lied with today .
The reduction for small fish therefore is " a per@@ fi@@ dious diver@@ sion@@ ary tactic which helps only the economy , " declares Wolf@@ schmidt .
Mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accum@@ ulates largely in the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that " even low levels , particularly in un@@ born children , can lead to damage to the nervous system . "
The German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a " health risk to the general population " is not anticipated .
Mercury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bun@@ de@@ stag member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , discharge more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rh@@ ine and Dan@@ u@@ be , is " extensively exceeded on a long-term basis , " the " Spiegel " newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
In the past year , Europe@@ -@@ wide alerts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
Food@@ watch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under : www.@@ qu@@ ec@@ ks@@ il@@ ber-@@ ak@@ tion@@ .@@ food@@ watch@@ .de
