A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brennan Centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ arer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning .
Indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republican representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , inv@@ ali@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitu@@ tion@@ ality of the Indiana law .
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Quebec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions disproportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that 's not all .
Students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abol@@ ishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without consequence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were African-Americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to Hispanics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
Several bills were blocked by vet@@ oes of Democratic governors .
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Pre@@ sidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the PSA test sometimes shows err@@ one@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
Enough to make already reluctant men hesit@@ ate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer .
African-American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive cancers and others that are in@@ dol@@ ent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Therefore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the Soci@@ é@@ té internation@@ ale d '@@ uro@@ log@@ ie [ SI@@ U ] , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test .
You can download the document ( in English for the time being , a [ French ] translation will be available shortly ) at this address : http : / / ca@@ .@@ mov@@ ember@@ .com / f@@ r / men@@ s-@@ health / pro@@ state-@@ canc@@ er-@@ screening
Pre@@ vent@@ ing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
" If no more people smoked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says André Beau@@ lieu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are her@@ edit@@ ary .
Some are also completely un@@ explained .
For the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers .
C@@ igare@@ ttes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massively damages people 's health .
" Even today , there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec " deplo@@ res spokesperson André Beau@@ lieu .
En@@ cour@@ aging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
Weight
Over@@ weight and obesity are also condu@@ ci@@ ve to the onset of the disease , according to the S@@ CC .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , colon and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , pancre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us .
" Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer " it is also said .
Die@@ t
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing col@@ o-@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
Like@@ wise , so do c@@ ured meat products , and these should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
" They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained .
Vit@@ amins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer .
For the time being however their research is in@@ conclusive .
Studies on vitamin E are contradic@@ tory , according to the S@@ CC .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphas@@ ises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
" Taking a screening test doesn 't give you cancer . "
The Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe , no less .
Also it is the last partic@@ le whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cally .
But for physic@@ ists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ gs .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic partic@@ le , and greatly resembles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predicted by the Standard Model .
In addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let 's suppose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fatally un@@ avoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go mad .
However , even though partic@@ le physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Paul@@ i exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same " quant@@ um state " - this " state " consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
Based on this , physic@@ ists classi@@ fy particles into two categories .
In one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ m@@ ions , who wisely o@@ bey the Paul@@ i principle .
While lur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a nasty band of anarch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Labs Par@@ tic@@ le Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and " force particles " by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
These bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the pho@@ ton , or the " light partic@@ le " which is the " messen@@ ger " of the electro@@ magnetic force .
When , in fact , a partic@@ le having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this " distur@@ bs " the electro@@ magnetic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ eb@@ ble thrown in a pond .
This " disturb@@ ance " produces an electro@@ magnetic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ultra@@ viol@@ et etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a pho@@ ton - and thus one of the " force carrier " bo@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be " disturbed " for the bo@@ son to appear .
Now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wr@@ inkle the surface .
Which is why a huge partic@@ le acceler@@ ator like the one at CER@@ N - the Large Had@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The an@@ alog@@ y with the electro@@ magnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
In fact not all particles , or all materials , interact with the electro@@ magnetic field .
Some , such as mag@@ nets , do so , but others don 't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fri@@ dge .
And like@@ wise , not all particles interact with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the pho@@ ton ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ on@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the vali@@ dity of the Standard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physicians to examine any discrepan@@ cies between the observations and predictions of the SM .
A number of people , mo@@ re@@ over , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sli@@ gh@@ test difference could open a door to a " new physics " and plug certain holes in the Model .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Universe ( re-@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such discrepan@@ cies have been found at CER@@ N .
Re@@ perc@@ ussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won 't be any .
Remember : in the very early 60s , the p@@ ion@@ e@@ ers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work .
They had an in@@ kling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Will@@ ard Boyle - a physic@@ ist who worked at Bell Labs , where the laser was invented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a " lab gad@@ get . "
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that surro@@ unds research .
For example , the same Will@@ ard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , during his work in op@@ tics .
This sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ HC will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... | Le De@@ voir
With its D@@ ying with Dign@@ ity Commission , Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le De@@ voir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ gie apartment .
The fest@@ ering prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year resp@@ ite .
" They gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
" But it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it " he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
Sitting in front of an app@@ et@@ ising lunch , he con@@ s@@ ents to being helped to eat , resigned .
Cour@@ age@@ ous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bustling around him , bringing him his medication , offering him a bath .
The courage of ordinary death .
" What I want most is to be c@@ ured of my diarr@@ ho@@ ea , it 's humiliating " he confi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
" During our lives , we learn that a man p@@ is@@ ses standing up , " says Pierre Bro@@ deur , psychologist at the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home .
Reg@@ ressing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
" It depends on the person 's ability " to accept the reg@@ res@@ sion , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such reg@@ res@@ sion .
Patients at the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called " cur@@ ative " care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . "
But the disease has made me discover my children .
" I have fine children " she adds .
" I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe .
She looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding .
This is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Quebec , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care beds for 11,@@ 700 inhabitants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christ@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink br@@ and@@ y or Pepsi , whatever is their ti@@ pple .
Di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased .
" We help relatives as much as patients " says Nath@@ alie Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
At the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 93@@ -year-old man who is sa@@ vo@@ uring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly we@@ dged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ asts are drunk in his honour , a 36-@@ year-@@ young man is dying trag@@ ically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
" For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a concerned Dr Christ@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
Lack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of Canadians simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of organisations , such as the Victor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , speci@@ alise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthan@@ asia and assisted suicide .
Since October , a manifesto , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care lumin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bernard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr Christ@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ tel , the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthan@@ asia .
Recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some onc@@ ologists work relent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chemotherapy .
When I announced to my onc@@ ologist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she regret@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acc@@ eded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to El@@ sie Mon@@ ere@@ au , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physicians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ adic@@ ally or permanently .
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , an un@@ relieved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation .
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing : " I want to die . "
But this does not necessarily mean " I want you to euthan@@ ise me , " it means " I want to be relieved . "
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research instit@@ utes .
Wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad real estate scandals in Quebec
Day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund-@@ raisers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable " system , " combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade union@@ ists and organised crime .
An " industry " which has cost Quebec taxpayers de@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
" It is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures " says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au iron@@ ically , a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had con@@ sent@@ ed only reluc@@ tantly .
The " Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , under-@@ the-@@ table financing of parties and bribery of officials .
" Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share !
The Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission " has already brought down two mayors " he adds , hoping that it will succeed in " revealing the schemes behind the individuals . "
A permanent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 2011
The Perman@@ ent Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors .
Plus the " Mar@@ teau squad " policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal " se@@ wer cartel " to soft pedal on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ tte , Mayor of a suburban town .
Next on the list is apparently G@@ illes Va@@ ill@@ an@@ court , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Lav@@ al , third largest city in Quebec .
He is suspected of pock@@ eting repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts .
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ cur@@ so and Lin@@ o Zam@@ bit@@ o .
The latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts " system " to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ é@@ r@@ ald Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay 's party .
Mr Zam@@ bit@@ o has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 88@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liber@@ als then in power .
He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal De@@ put@@ y-@@ Prime Minister , Nath@@ alie Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
Se@@ wer contracts with inflated costs
In Montreal , the corruption " system " ran smoothly .
G@@ illes Sur@@ pr@@ en@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , inv@@ itations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and bribes tot@@ alling 7@@ 36,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he inflated the costs .
Other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by inf@@ lating in@@ voices by 30 to 40 % , and by false ad@@ d-@@ ons .
Then an organis@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin Dum@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these revelations , Mr Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay resigned in early November , plunging Montreal into a major crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ leau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
Mayor of the borough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re-@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and re@@ sold for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pr@@ its . "
The process , she says , is " painful but positive . "
The wound is being cleaned , but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .
How to clean house .
Pro@@ per@@ ly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that " officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially concerned about the role of " elected people aware of the scheme , " when they were not up to their ne@@ cks in the scam !
Estim@@ ating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality . "
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " Until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . "
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : " We can 't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . "
Although this story tarn@@ ishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
" PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! "
This season , you have taken on a new stature with PS@@ G .
How do you explain this progression ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PS@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I 'm making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it 's easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don 't get worked up .
From my debut at the Cla@@ i@@ ref@@ on@@ taine IN@@ F pre-@@ training centre to my transfer to Saint-@@ Eti@@ enne , I 've always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancelotti ...
This summer 's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot as regards my position .
He 's supported by deputies like Claude Mak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
Is Ancelotti the man for the job ?
Defin@@ itely .
Ancelotti inspi@@ res respect among all the experts .
Today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he 's one of the best coaches in Europe .
He has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
He 's worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you att@@ ach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ?
In Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top .
But we 're waiting on the sidelines .
One of our main goals is the Champions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club 's goal in this competition ?
We 'll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
Today , this isn 't the case .
Fin@@ anci@@ ally , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen .
In Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
Defin@@ itely , it would be a major disappointment .
This year , we 're really committed to winning the championship .
We weren 't far away last season .
In May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terrific season .
We finished with 79 points .
Normally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mont@@ pel@@ lier , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Marseille , Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ?
It 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4-0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating .
You wonder what more people expect .
You 're never going to win 4-0 every weekend .
We 're not FC Barcelona !
We 're trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Champions League proved we could hold our own .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Marseille , who were no good last season , were " boosted " by the new PS@@ G .
This shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic .
So much so that people say there is a " Z@@ lat@@ an dependence . "
This means I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
That 's why he came , and he 's proving he 's the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
He 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly exceptional .
It pushes others to raise their level of play .
Thi@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I 'm playing well in selection matches .
Which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ apt@@ ism with the Blues .
I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exempl@@ ary behaviour .
What do think about Didier Des@@ champ@@ s 's first few months in charge of the Blues ?
He has the results he wanted .
We 're well placed in the World qualifying group .
The coach is tough , close to the players , and inspi@@ res them to win .
Like Laurent Blanc was .
But I don 't want to make any comparisons .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Didier Des@@ champ@@ s will take the Blues to Brazil .
Did the good draw ( 1-1 ) snatched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
Everybody fought for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I 'd never experienced such a match in my career .
With Bit@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ pable : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking mon@@ opo@@ lies , leads to financial crises .
In fact , Bit@@ coin , invented by Sat@@ o@@ shi Nak@@ am@@ oto ( a p@@ seudonym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but convertible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like Bit@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ peer file exchange .
Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network .
Close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
The bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ coin as " the most successful virtual currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to conventional currencies . "
Bit@@ coin diff@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as ' credits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and handles the exchanges .
With Bit@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both custo@@ dians of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issuers , and buyers and sellers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail .
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electron@@ ically by a du@@ al-@@ key encryp@@ tion system .
So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction .
Using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
This is a file h@@ ashing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print .
Computers " take " the new transaction and add a number to it , then " h@@ ash " it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
The transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print .
If a user wanted to de@@ fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an orph@@ an because the two have different im@@ prints .
The computer that re@@ sol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
To avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred million@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power .
The life of the network has had its ups and downs .
Web@@ sites providing services for Bit@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stolen .
" The loophole used is not the protocol itself " says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ coin network .
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service .
But cash also has this weakness .
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature .
Others , such as the W@@ ord@@ Press blog platform , accept them .
Recently , Ad@@ i Sham@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circul@@ ate .
In November , " huge sell@@ -@@ offs " were launched .
" Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were exchanged " welcomes Jon Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ tun@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ act@@ less payment by mobile , but it uses Bit@@ coin to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement by merchants , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
There is a general movement to re@@ app@@ raise hier@@ arch@@ ical systems for more horizon@@ tal systems .
" It will take time for Bit@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , " he predicts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success .
We got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ isa and S@@ uro@@ bi ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the Sovie@@ ts .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ a@@ ic , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uz@@ be@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
T@@ oler@@ ated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when Western@@ ers become more scarce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of al@@ mond trees planted with French funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion .
Con@@ voys of trucks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , over@@ flown by helicopters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014 .
Circ@@ um@@ stances have changed since their ir@@ resist@@ ible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kabul was empty , the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions .
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to safety .
Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is paid the price of the obsc@@ ur@@ ant@@ ism of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
Former Mu@@ jah@@ id@@ in , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an infer@@ ior position .
The main anti@@ -So@@ vie@@ t war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became prof@@ ite@@ ers , seizing government land to re@@ sell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts .
They have become discre@@ dited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thieves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its ide@@ ologies .
They have rub@@ bed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ ghly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obsc@@ ur@@ ant@@ ism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish soap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti@@ -So@@ vie@@ t struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain dec@@ entr@@ alisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centr@@ alised State , with strong presidential power , abol@@ ishing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
But , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been re-@@ established , no dams are in good condition , no major irrigation systems have been repaired .
Everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
In a country ruined by thir@@ ty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the Western@@ ers were only there to seize it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archae@@ ological Delegation .
Since 2009 , to try to " win hearts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a " ci@@ v@@ il-@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ im@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French N@@ GO , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
These projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insurgency : irrigation , wells , drinking water , re@@ forestation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a souven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these v@@ alleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level .
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ isa province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gamble for President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his " auto@@ cr@@ atic deli@@ ri@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' tr@@ ample the law . "
His supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ tians .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute r@@ ages throughout the country .
Mohammed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ tians will vote favour@@ ably , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
Par@@ tic@@ ularly since a ha@@ sty vote sm@@ acks of an ultim@@ atum to the Egyptian people : " Either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , " these powers supposedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islamist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liberals were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slammed the door , feeling they had failed to assert their views .
Representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done like@@ wise .
In order to obtain a qu@@ orum , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were hast@@ ily added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brother@@ hood .
Not surprisingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
Com@@ ment@@ ators were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 234 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stip@@ ulating that " the principles of shar@@ ia are the main source of law . "
The Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed stricter application .
For the Islamists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
" Hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y " respond the liberals , who see only a communication coup .
Because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ har University an advisory role , with particular reference to ver@@ ifying the con@@ form@@ ity of the laws with shar@@ ia .
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pom@@ m@@ ier , this is worrying because " the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
This suggests the beg@@ innings of a the@@ ocr@@ acy . "
The liberals ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
" For the time being , there is no concrete religious implic@@ ation .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the French system " quali@@ fies Alexis Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowledges that " there may be some ambig@@ u@@ ity regarding article 220 , because the terms used borrow from the religious voc@@ ab@@ ulary .
Re@@ ference is made in particular to " fi@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic jur@@ isp@@ ru@@ dence , Editor 's note ] .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pron@@ ounce on it . "
Beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers con@@ ferred on the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider re@@ pressive .
The offence of blas@@ ph@@ emy is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights Heb@@ a Mor@@ ay@@ ef , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohib@@ ition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday .
In Israel , holy places await Ukrainian tourists , the om@@ p@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Holy Land combines the spl@@ end@@ our of bib@@ lical tru@@ ths , modern comfort and prime@@ val nature .
Ai@@ F [ Argum@@ ent@@ i i Fak@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let 's worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was b@@ apti@@ zed .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ apt@@ ism " bath " are blessed by God .
Gal@@ il@@ ee is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and filled the nets .
This is also where Jesus came before his dis@@ ci@@ ples and after the resurrec@@ tion .
But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem .
Belie@@ vers walk through the Way of G@@ rie@@ f or Via Dol@@ or@@ os@@ a .
It starts by the Anton@@ ia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ et@@ orium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ tha - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ ion , Stone of Un@@ ction and the place of Jesus ' burial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian om@@ p@@ hal@@ os , which symbo@@ li@@ zes the sal@@ vation of man@@ kind .
The Holy Cross Mon@@ ast@@ ery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that , according to Christian legend , yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus ' cruci@@ fix@@ ion .
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD .
According to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Travel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins of the Mas@@ sa@@ da Fort@@ ress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
Others are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00-@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which fills up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski pist@@ es is 45 km .
According to an ancient legend , p@@ agan go@@ ds used to live on the mountain .
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums .
You won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Kn@@ es@@ set ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran manuscri@@ pts and Dead Sea sc@@ rolls found in the c@@ aves of the Ju@@ dean desert , along with about 500,000 archae@@ ological and anthropolog@@ ical ar@@ te@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv is also interesting .
Its exhibits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Ren@@ o@@ ir , S@@ isley , C@@ ez@@ anne , Mat@@ isse , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Ch@@ ag@@ all , Picasso .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al@@ -B@@ asha , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish b@@ aths with models of visitors and bath atten@@ dants of the time .
In Caes@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dal@@ i and Rod@@ in .
There are no tour guides or gift shops .
En@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers .
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness .
Stars are glim@@ mering ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
Well@@ ness
There are three resort areas in Israel , located on the co@@ asts of the Mediterranean , Red , and Dead Se@@ as .
Each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dol@@ ph@@ in@@ aria and oce@@ an@@ aria .
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees .
The Dead Sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you afloat , even if you don 't know how to swim .
The surrounding landscap@@ es are surreal in their beauty .
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medic@@ inal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have dermat@@ itis , allergies , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ zem@@ as , arthritis , bron@@ ch@@ itis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
Touch the myster@@ ies of antiqu@@ ity
They are preserved in the old section of Tel@@ -@@ Aviv - in the town of Jaff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
The famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , Anat@@ oli@@ a , and Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legen@@ ds .
According to legen@@ ds , this is where Noah built his ark and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beauty An@@ dro@@ me@@ da , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
Tour@@ ists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac .
They say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
In Jaff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
And in Caes@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , " capture " the Crus@@ ader fort@@ ress .
During the Roman period , Caes@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Roman pre@@ f@@ ects , including Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate .
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances .
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel , don 't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for sh@@ ek@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.8 sh@@ ek@@ els ) .
City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram , and Haifa has the only subway line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
In essence , it is an underground cable railway .
A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 sh@@ ek@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bath is celebrated in Israel .
Between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many cafes , restaurants and hotels have only ko@@ sher food , with no pork , seafood , fish with no sc@@ ales , or dishes that combine milk with meat .
There is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts cooked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus paste , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ af@@ el ( balls made of ground chick@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don 't have homeless dogs .
But there are many well-@@ fed cats , which walk around la@@ z@@ ily .
In the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked cars .
These p@@ us@@ sy@@ cats like busy places and do not refuse treats .
Car rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hyundai G@@ etz ) to 188 ( Audi A@@ 6 , Volvo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
Bi@@ ke rental costs 15 sh@@ ek@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 sh@@ ek@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
Visitors and holi@@ day@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
Only the " high and mighty " make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates .
Every year , 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
Mo@@ stly these are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan , Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Turkmen@@ istan .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which oblig@@ es every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test .
For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested .
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
People who received education certificates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the USS@@ R in 1991 are also exempt under the law .
Pur@@ pose , doomed fate , and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the ausp@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Pe@@ oples ' Friend@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
M@@ ig@@ rants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened .
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Dum@@ a members and the Federal Migration Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Viktor Seb@@ ele@@ v .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ ig@@ rants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems .
If a migrant does not understand the language , says Seb@@ ele@@ v with certainty , he is doomed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people , who , pretending to help , will force upon him a " ticket " to terrible , cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12-@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our migrants .
" They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , " confirms the Head of the Main M@@ ig@@ rant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Shar@@ i@@ po@@ v .
Not be angry , boss !
Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
Natur@@ ally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , Uz@@ be@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
Their families don 't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
After reaching adol@@ escence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
" You feel humili@@ ated and infer@@ ior . "
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
" Welcome , or No Un@@ authorized En@@ try "
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12,000 to 16,000 rub@@ les .
W@@ here@@ as a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extortion .
" They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , " Um@@ ed Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ adam@@ ov , a citizen of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan , shared with journalists .
" Roll up , don 't be cheap , get your artwork "
On the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake .
A few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already .
For@@ ged documents are printed on a standard colour prin@@ ter .
Natur@@ ally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tou@@ g@@ hen up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : CL@@ IC@@ K shots at weddings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vin@@ ogra@@ do@@ v , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Poli@@ c@@ emen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the Dum@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ aro@@ v@@ aya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Dum@@ a in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " tightening the scre@@ ws . "
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the " sen@@ sel@@ ess tough@@ ening . "
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer Vas@@ ily Les@@ nik@@ ov to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Interior 's statistics , 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tough@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Supp@@ liers : from plants to officers
The " black " market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several channels .
There are five such channels , explains retired colon@@ el Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
Screen@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
First : " army or military loo@@ t , " i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
" We@@ ap@@ ons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans , " says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
Next are " black weapons , " stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police w@@ are@@ houses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military w@@ are@@ houses .
Explo@@ sions have often been heard at military w@@ are@@ houses .
" There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , " says the former military man .
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
" There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert .
Another source of the " black " market is trafficking .
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan .
" There 's production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a mafia has formed , which has organized a stream , " explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Experts counted the appro@@ xim@@ ate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market .
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011 .
Experts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from port@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , " states the report .
According to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black archae@@ ology . "
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by " black " dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they 're too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods .
One piece , for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the fence .
" He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , " he says .
" The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants , " says the consultant .
" Like in a luxury store "
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blogs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ v@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " corner " so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military commentator Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consultant . - I have an acquain@@ tance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable .
There are sales@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to " come " there con@@ ditionally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth . "
Right now , even if I need a few kn@@ uck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away .
Beg@@ inners look for weapons in different ways .
Former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The formul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with " anything and everything . "
" I felt like I was in a luxury store , " he recalls .
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
" I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , " describes the expert .
Store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and " V@@ kon@@ tak@@ te " groups , where weapons " for different purposes " are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
" It 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the advertisement heading on the website " Buy a pistol or rifle . "
Users leave their requests and ask questions .
Can a minor buy ?
" Without a license , of course , " asks user " John " ( name is changed ) .
" Want to buy a TT , Moscow , " conc@@ is@@ ely requests " Fed@@ or@@ en@@ kov . "
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
People come like hungry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Siber@@ ia .
military commentator and former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applic@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
People accept orders .
The buyer pays at an ATM .
" In response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , " says Press Secretary of the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons non-@@ governmental organization Dmitry Kis@@ lo@@ v .
Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail .
The Federal Security Service now spreads a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
" People are like hungry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Siber@@ ia mining coal , " - he says .
Mak@@ aro@@ v for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to Dmitry Kis@@ lo@@ v from the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons organization , a Mak@@ aro@@ v gun can be acquired for 100-@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is shipped from long-term storage w@@ are@@ houses by the mid-@@ level management of these w@@ are@@ houses .
According to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to Janu@@ ary-@@ October 2011 , amoun@@ ting to 22,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.8 % .
Fast@@ -@@ food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S.@@ A .
Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald 's at one time or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.@@ A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Wal@@ mart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald 's , Burger King , T@@ aco Bell , Wendy 's and Kentucky Fri@@ ed Chicken .
Right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fiz@@ z@@ le out early .
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mart and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
Ac@@ tions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mart corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and pick@@ eted together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mart sells everything imaginable , from di@@ apers , hunting rifles and car batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets .
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ mart employees shop only at their workplace .
Avail@@ ability and ass@@ ort@@ ment made Wal@@ mart one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ mart can afford to sell the products cheap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand-@@ held sc@@ ann@@ ers .
Protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ mart employee , receiving 9.5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scientists from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Wal@@ mart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.1 % more than it spends on salaries right now .
If Wal@@ mart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation .
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mart sold about 5000 products a second .
In total , its cash regist@@ ers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Representative of the corporation , Dan Fo@@ gel@@ man , asserted in an interview with a left-wing site , the Huffington Post , that a total of " less than five " Wal@@ mart employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just " another PR trick " of the union that organized it .
" Free cash register ! "
Protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mart ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don 't exist here yet ) , but McDonald 's and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald 's says that it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
J@@ um@@ a@@ ane Williams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
Nobody earns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald 's , working part-time after school , living with parents .
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald 's employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Participants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald 's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cash@@ iers and coo@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nag@@ ging or firing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
Dis@@ agreeing
No@@ isy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald 's by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , J@@ um@@ a@@ ane Williams , said : " McDonald 's claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! "
Demonstr@@ ators were supported by other prominent NY demo@@ crats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for NY city mayor , who said : " We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic well@@ being , which every New Yorker deserves ! . "
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comp@@ rise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement .
" At the moment , the mind cannot be dec@@ eived too well "
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is aug@@ mented reality , lately seen primarily through the pris@@ m of special glasses .
At first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too .
However , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Shah@@ ram Iz@@ adi , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manip@@ ulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
While people in general are stuck at working with pix@@ els on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predict car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , Xbox and Kin@@ ect sensors are a step forward . Almost no Xbox is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gestures .
- What else awaits us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
Information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly three-@@ dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projection technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
Above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It 's a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re-@@ for-@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own niche .
For example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
Mo@@ v@@ ements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bracel@@ et that determined the movement of bones and muscles .
It 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.@@ g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- Usually I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual appro@@ xim@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction .
This could be , e.@@ g. laser sensors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kin@@ ect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimensional recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight mega pix@@ els with 1000 k / s speed .
It 's not just the mega pix@@ els , though , but the quality of the mat@@ rix and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorith@@ m designers .
So it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z a@@ xis .
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gestures .
Steven B@@ ath@@ iche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red em@@ itter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object 's depth .
Po@@ ten@@ tially , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
It would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue Kin@@ ect , play with the flex@@ ion of camera dispos@@ ition and see how this will help in three-@@ dimensional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public , unlike Google .
Don 't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of aug@@ mented reality technologies ?
- Certainly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be " transitional " aug@@ mented reality , where you could shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform .
Gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - aug@@ mented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual hol@@ ogra@@ phic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tac@@ tile feedback !
Hands feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lectures I often say that aug@@ mented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tac@@ tile sens@@ ations .
For now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of mat@@ rix for the image .
It is great at registering pushes !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultras@@ ound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your finger@@ tip .
There are also wrist bracel@@ ets that affect the nerve end@@ ings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven 't tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ mills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant balloons .
So far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come .
That 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beg@@ innings .
Jud@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t.@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ alt continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant-@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the av@@ ant-@@ garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , byp@@ assing fame in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ b@@ alt - the bold artist Kir@@ ill Miller .
The whole city knows Kir@@ ill Miller , a be@@ arded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Kir@@ ill Miller 's work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
Kir@@ ill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical story@@ tell@@ ers and creators of new myth@@ ology .
Kir@@ ill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant-@@ garde of the late 80 's early 90 's .
Moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit .
Recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Boh@@ em@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Kir@@ ill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or tur@@ quo@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a compromise between artist , im@@ age-@@ maker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my provoc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you realise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to me that this is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post-@@ Gaza-@@ Nev@@ sky style artists ( " post-@@ gaz@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina " ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I 'm drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your Ar@@ t-@@ clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Boh@@ em@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Boh@@ emia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , Te@@ qu@@ ila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the Van Gogh 's E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ nur and his friends lip sang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trendy composer Igor V@@ do@@ vin was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ing@@ ra@@ d .
Tra@@ kh@@ tenberg was the presenter of many programs before Hali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them Tra@@ kh@@ tenberg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
Gallery D 137 , Gri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these echo the Ar@@ t-@@ clinic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated Artist of the Year , my cli@@ max came to an end .
In the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recogn@@ izable style .
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhibit , " Russian museum in c@@ low@@ ns . "
C@@ low@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and scary to be like that .
But everything is blur@@ red in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like grotes@@ que , I have grotes@@ que ideas .
For example , saving the world by total@@ itarian changing of clothes by order .
Now@@ adays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Recently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Now@@ adays , commercial art should be neat , consider@@ ate , sweet .
There is a dis@@ integration of cultures .
People used to get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ em@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , everybody is divided into mic@@ ro societies , it 's hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cult hero has 100 fans .
- But several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ il@@ ov !
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ al-@@ social sphere is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Lar@@ ion@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
Con@@ cep@@ ts are often mixed up these days .
People say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it 's " from another opera . "
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
This is the culture I 'm for .
- Kir@@ ill , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right rulers everything was different . Kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are good consultants in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Jud@@ gement calls are what thrive now .
Even Er@@ art , but they 're different because they say honestly that we don 't accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
It 's hard for art to grow on our rocks .
We need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many curious people , who go to art exhibits , concerts .
Here , this layer is thin .
We need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger .
Global warming or an encounter with a killer ast@@ ero@@ id .
Car@@ av@@ ans of cosm@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
To save humanity , the question is how to propag@@ ate our race in conditions of weigh@@ t@@ lessness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothe@@ tically .
" Venus and Mars , " says Senior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P.@@ K. Sh@@ tern@@ berg State Astron@@ omy Institute ( G@@ AI@@ S@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ din .
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Venus has 500-@@ degree temperatures .
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus ... in space .
The question of re@@ production in space began with fl@@ ora .
Half a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
Four generations of pe@@ as grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts .
Then , insects were bred in orbit , small fruit flies .
In 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embr@@ yo develops in weigh@@ t@@ lessness .
We get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
" The problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , " explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Problems ( IM@@ BP ) R@@ AN Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
Having found no support , ch@@ icks were tumbling around in disorder .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete atro@@ phy of instincts .
Chic@@ ks did not react to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
" We bred ch@@ icks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confirming the failure of the experiment with ch@@ icks in space .
The last biological " mini-@@ ark " with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago .
In spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
However , only same-sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bi@@ o-@@ satellite .
There was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with fo@@ etus .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
" This was on bi@@ o-@@ satellites , but again , it was a sing@@ ular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
After landing , the cosm@@ ic rats had babies .
But it 's hard to solve the problem of re@@ production directly in space .
It 's not an easy task .
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct , when they 're out of their familiar environment .
In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Homo sa@@ pi@@ ens have abstract thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ esh@@ kova .
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
Our " Se@@ ag@@ ull " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
" Nobody answered this question , " says rocket and space industry veteran , V@@ ak@@ ht@@ ang V@@ ach@@ nad@@ ze .
In June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Valent@@ ina Ter@@ esh@@ kova gave birth to a daughter .
The child 's father , An@@ dri@@ an Nikol@@ a@@ ev , was also a co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut , Svet@@ lana Sav@@ it@@ skaya , who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few co@@ s@@ mon@@ auts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
" What 's more , it is dangerous even for or@@ b@@ ital flights , " adds pilot and co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut , Hero of the USS@@ R , Hero of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov .
And yet , humanity needs to seek out some new aven@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity .
Hydro@@ -@@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , co@@ s@@ mon@@ auts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o-@@ gravity conditions .
Water im@@ it@@ ates weigh@@ t@@ lessness .
If for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for infants it is a native element .
Small amp@@ hib@@ ians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ otic fluid in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first ba@@ thing .
" This is very little time to forget something , " says infant swimming instructor Marina Ak@@ sen@@ ova .
In other words , if for a newborn weigh@@ t@@ lessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth 's pull .
St@@ om@@ ach and pel@@ vic muscles usually quickly de@@ generate in weigh@@ t@@ lessness ; the ability to push out the embr@@ yo is reduced .
Well , let 's assume that child@@ birth stimul@@ ators will work out .
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
" Then what ? " - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non-@@ tri@@ vial issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity .
When a body does not feel the earth 's pull , it does not form the skelet@@ al and muscular system .
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
" And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handic@@ apped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , " predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ BP R@@ AN Igor Pest@@ ov .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it l@@ ags behind in their application .
This was said by Mil@@ os@@ lav Kal@@ a , vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .c@@ z .
" The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states Kal@@ a , commenting on the current situation .
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors .
As an example of improper practice , they cite Petr Nec@@ as 's approach to the so-called " S@@ var@@ c System . "
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
" The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce , " asser@@ ts Kal@@ a .
At the audit committee 's session in the House of De@@ puties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel aud@@ iting , which we began around two years ago .
Simply put , this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legis@@ l@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more conc@@ ise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confirms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that prof@@ ite@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be proc@@ ured .
The system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of paperwork , and those , who wish to look for loop@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ?
As far as the office is concerned , the Bun@@ des@@ re@@ chn@@ ung@@ sh@@ of functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
Powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised federally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own .
The BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
Overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such comparisons .
It should be said that even in a country we perc@@ eive as exempl@@ ary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
Coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our audit work yet .
Since we carry out our au@@ dits ex-@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future au@@ dits - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk detection " system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes " too con@@ strained " and will not be enfor@@ ce@@ able .
Under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of bud@@ get@@ ary discipline .
Is it worth con@@ straining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ ic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening businessmen with au@@ dits of the so-called " S@@ var@@ c System " - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohibits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce .
He may say : " Let us change this law and relax it , " but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the form@@ alities which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ ic@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
Ro@@ ads are icy in places , but mostly pass@@ able .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snow@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places .
Carls@@ bad region
In the Carls@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snow@@ y .
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
Sno@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands .
However , the ri@@ dges of the Kr@@ us@@ ne Mountains have around 30 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist , according to the local highway service .
The R@@ 6 high-speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and sli@@ pper@@ y .
All secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads .
In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow patches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice and H@@ ra@@ de@@ c Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Boh@@ emia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher alt@@ itudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motor@@ way Direc@@ torate .
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher alt@@ itudes of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice region in particular .
Black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ sti n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ avy , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ avy .
Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke mountains .
At higher alt@@ itudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ ch@@ no@@ v n@@ ad Kne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
In Eastern Boh@@ emia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Temper@@ atures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly , with a light wind .
Pil@@ sen region
The roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . Drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be icy .
Drivers should expect mist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region 's highway service .
The D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilomet@@ re marks .
Most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ st-@@ free .
Southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have icy patches .
Secon@@ d@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy patches .
Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Boh@@ em@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region .
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to V@@ id@@ el@@ sky Kri@@ z .
Snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions .
" In the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest alt@@ itudes .
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ ke sed@@ lo in the direction of Jes@@ en@@ ik , " the dispat@@ ch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
Their Jes@@ en@@ ik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest alt@@ itudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 's roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of S@@ tern@@ ber@@ k drivers should bew@@ are in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region , Li@@ bere@@ c region
Since this morning , the snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Boh@@ emia .
Besides certain sno@@ w-@@ covered places , or some icy fro@@ st patches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ in@@ ice in the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
Temper@@ atures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and icy . In the low@@ lands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Boh@@ em@@ ian U@@ pl@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
No traffic hol@@ d-@@ ups have so far been reported .
I@@ cy fro@@ st patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
According to meteor@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and freezing temperatures .
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Li@@ bere@@ c regions .
The closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ in@@ ice road was caused by bent tree branches , which were weighed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ nest : At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another start@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The T@@ ap T@@ ap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
Can you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.@@ m .
On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ?
Initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Augu@@ sta .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t-@@ shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e-@@ tap@@ .c@@ z to support our cause .
The T@@ ap T@@ ap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world , called " The End of the World is cancelled . "
It is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the fund-raising concerts ?
Of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end beforehand .
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television .
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Han@@ ak , Xin@@ d@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund-raising events and concerts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
Equi@@ pping the wheel@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ deo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association T@@ ap from the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the disabled .
T@@ utors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford t@@ utors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to comp@@ ile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support Les@@ bi@@ ens , Il@@ lu@@ strat@@ o@@ sphere with Dan Bar@@ ta , The T@@ ap T@@ ap , Marian Bang@@ o and J@@ iri Such@@ y will appear .
Further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .c@@ z .
Are you planning any more " bomb@@ astic events " in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The T@@ ap T@@ ap is nonetheless a band composed of handic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation ?
It is not as scary as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electric wheel@@ chairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CS@@ A and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
Thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific acc@@ essi@@ bility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
What have been your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beg@@ innings .
Compared to Prague , Moscow is rather in@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
Ob@@ vious things , such as giving wheel@@ chairs priority in lifts , are not common@@ place there .
Fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handic@@ aps to be independently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The T@@ ap T@@ ap we are a step ahead !
Public respect or acc@@ essi@@ bility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only exceptional cases , people who are str@@ ong-@@ w@@ illed .
The T@@ ap T@@ ap band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a t@@ utor at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , as our moderator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) .
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistaken ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
We realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality t@@ utors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The T@@ ap T@@ ap to such heights ?
From the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
Show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ ates the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time .
Things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that T@@ ap T@@ ap is one of those things .
A person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
But that pity is simply wasted , because handic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be p@@ iti@@ ed .
They are people , who can fully live life and blos@@ som , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handic@@ ap succeeds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ compromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehear@@ sals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappe@@ ars .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The T@@ ap T@@ ap band currently has tw@@ enty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avoidable .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ pm .
The venues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ eb@@ a , Br@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va Pl@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a televised lin@@ k-@@ up at the evening 's close for a united rendition of The T@@ ap T@@ ap 's anthem " The End of the World is cancelled "
The concert 's goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi-@@ functional whe@@ el-@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crow@@ ns .
Ad@@ mission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ em@@ i@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland and the Co@@ smo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the tw@@ enti@@ eth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish b@@ off@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A S@@ tern@@ feld in Warsaw 's astron@@ omy observ@@ atory , who , on the 6th of December 1933 , presented ideas on his pioneering work En@@ try into space .
The thoughts of the young engineer ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later S@@ tern@@ feld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
In 1934 , for his work En@@ try into space , S@@ tern@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ aul@@ t-@@ Pel@@ ter@@ ie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski ( 1899 - 1966 ) later became a strong promoter of astron@@ omy and astron@@ au@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ om@@ ski became a world-@@ known promoter of astron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Moon was named after him .
In 1925 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project 's designer , and the project 's details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs .
The research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mie@@ cz@@ ys@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof. Gust@@ aw Mo@@ kr@@ zy@@ ck@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army interrupted the research .
In 1937 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing rocket designed by engineer Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air torpe@@ do and flying rocket-@@ bomb appeared , authored by L@@ eli@@ w@@ y-@@ Kr@@ y@@ wob@@ lock@@ i .
Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provis@@ ional Scientific Advisory Board ( T@@ ym@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y Kom@@ it@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ Nau@@ kow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to astron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astron@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie Tow@@ arz@@ yst@@ wo Astron@@ au@@ ty@@ cz@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954 , in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astron@@ au@@ tics .
In one of these , by Prof. Su@@ bo@@ tow@@ icz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to astron@@ au@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosm@@ ic research was an emerging sector .
From the beginning of 1956 , the Polish Astron@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International Astron@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member .
In the following year , the P@@ TA 's first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ ier@@ z Zar@@ ank@@ ie@@ wicz ( 19@@ 02 - 1959 ) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astron@@ au@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
From 1956 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of meteor@@ ological rockets R@@ M ( Rak@@ ie@@ ta Meteor@@ olog@@ ic@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M-@@ 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 .
The rocket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
Later , the improved R@@ M-@@ 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M-@@ 2 rocket in the Ble@@ dow@@ sky Desert .
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M-@@ 34 rocket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds .
Of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M rocket type was the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1 rocket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
The rocket was designed as a two-@@ stage rocket , with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
Three models were developed ( designated Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which diff@@ ered in the room available for scientific appar@@ atus .
In the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A rocket , a space of 0.4 lit@@ res was available , Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 lit@@ res , and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 lit@@ res .
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37@@ km .
Between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 was underway in the Aer@@ onau@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
Sub@@ sequently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 3 .
Poland 's admission to CO@@ SP@@ AR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SP@@ AR board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ ko@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ zewski became the second inter@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ kov .
Ab@@ ol@@ ishing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Constitutional Court abol@@ ished the law on public works .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial speculation .
Due to significant labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by impor@@ ting cheap goods , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bolstered by the businessman 's complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would alleviate the econom@@ ical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artif@@ ici@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs ch@@ ief@@ ly in amendments to existing law .
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
The au@@ ster@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emig@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to eke out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin .
Private capital cru@@ elly insists on the view@@ point that the State must not intervene in the economy .
Ther@@ eu@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ potent , and in all states , om@@ ni@@ present lobby .
The result is a desperate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ ishable .
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
Real power does not come from the people as the Western@@ -style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ ally-@@ ori@@ ent@@ ated democr@@ acies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : " The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With bribery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words .
Bri@@ bery and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hin@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought " ... " people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the state went eight months without consu@@ ls .. " .. " There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cr@@ acy , and an energetic man should be elected . " App@@ ian had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was Cesar who changed democracy for auto@@ cr@@ acy permanently .
The conclusion , just as in antiqu@@ ity , the current society is built on unsc@@ rup@@ ulous tenden@@ cies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented decad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
The c@@ aus@@ ality of the rise of the fasc@@ ist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liber@@ alisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witn@@ essing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The abol@@ ition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population 's living standards .
This pattern is thus systemic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Chaos Lab .
" Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , " from St@@ ing 's Frag@@ ile , where one of the main vers@@ es from the refrain is " L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . "
" If my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ ap@@ per , wife of Mayer Am@@ schel Rothschild in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has sparked a lot of reaction .
Some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self-@@ defence , and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated periodic waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gress@@ or and who is the victim , after all , today 's inhabitants of Israel , including the self-@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exu@@ des could not happen in one generation 's lif@@ esp@@ an .
Among these astron@@ om@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pup@@ pet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Reuters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of K@@ addaf@@ i 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
Who@@ ever attempted to defy this family died .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state-@@ issued ) money and was assassinated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre .
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Congressman Louis McFadden was po@@ isoned in 1936 , after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the form@@ ulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ ason leader of the 33@@ rd degree , Albert Pike .
The first war was to remove the large mon@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of slaves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ um@@ en@@ ism is just an app@@ et@@ iser for this solution ) , and finally the seizing of absolute power .
The method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds leading the way , employ is the inst@@ igation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab ch@@ ao - order from chaos ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) .
Thus , having succeeded in assass@@ in@@ ating Ferdinand , the Hab@@ sburg heir to the Au@@ stro@@ -@@ Hungarian throne , in Sarajevo thereby unle@@ ashing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended abruptly , milit@@ arily and economically un@@ substanti@@ ated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a-@@ Hungary were subsequently dismant@@ led .
To facilitate the inception of the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by sa@@ ddling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the impoverished masses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ prit and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi-@@ racial Cze@@ ch@@ os@@ lo@@ vakia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ignited .
At the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds inst@@ ig@@ ated the establishment of the Zion@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Return to Z@@ ion ) .
The af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Dec@@ lar@@ ation formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were l@@ ayed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hot@@ bed .
Provi@@ ded the international bankers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arabic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of disc@@ ord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the wrong@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palestin@@ e-@@ Israel conflict , where injustice bre@@ eds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel 's current prime minister , Netanyahu ' the hawk ' , is a typical example of a fasc@@ ist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to inst@@ ig@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Strait , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
In what light stand the words , spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : " All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . "
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial arist@@ oc@@ rats .
A world , where each new-@@ born is im@@ planted with a chip , which makes their existence completely sub@@ jug@@ ated .
" He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man 's number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . "
Ar@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Shah Mohammad Reza P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah over@@ board , because this would seriously jeopardi@@ se the trust of other allied countries .
The release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ ocr@@ atic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compounded by the fi@@ asco of attempting to free the hostages by force .
The incarcer@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Algerian government .
Their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The debacle in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter 's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ leck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the embassy was seized , six employees escaped .
After some peri@@ pet@@ ei@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian ambassador 's residence .
The CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an extravag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -fi blockbuster .
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan , conceived by " ex@@ filtr@@ ation " expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ t@@ itious production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ leck 's film is a pecu@@ liar mix of gen@@ res .
On one hand , there is a realistic inc@@ is@@ ive political thriller , and at the same time a " cap@@ er movie , " with small victories and double-@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean 's Eleven .
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp document@@ ary-@@ style sequ@@ ences in Tehran ( the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , lighter sections from Hollywood , laced with irony and a little exagger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ leck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style .
The der@@ ided actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
Ar@@ go is his third big-@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie Gone Baby Gone ( 2007 ) and the thriller The Town ( 2010 ) .
It is also Aff@@ leck 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's hometown of Boston .
The atmosp@@ heric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ leck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is " featured " by Canada .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impres@@ sively luc@@ id , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ leck and his team in the fic@@ t@@ itious scenes ( the fake staff at the Tehran b@@ az@@ aar ) .
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ ail@@ -@@ biting scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some occasional em@@ b@@ ell@@ ishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegan@@ tly ( the scene , where a looming crisis is aver@@ ted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-@@ fetched ) .
Ar@@ go 's weakness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ leck 's film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -style are e@@ voc@@ ative of thr@@ illers from the 70 's .
It does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate .
As a reminder of history 's particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for blowing up balloons , for ban@@ anas and a circus
The www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ n@@ ip@@ op@@ lat@@ k@@ y.com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . "
" We were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " Patri@@ k N@@ ach@@ er , the poll 's organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo .
Among the latest nominated absur@@ d@@ ities , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to un@@ ify insurance premiums for men and women .
Until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insurers .
" Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , " informed N@@ ach@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bi@@ o-@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequ@@ ently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mercury therm@@ ometers just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term " sp@@ read@@ able butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 cen@@ timet@@ res
The Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vet@@ oed ) .
The lobby 's interests were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and " anom@@ alous cur@@ v@@ ature . "
The European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing direc@@ tives .
One possible pri@@ ze-@@ winner in the poll may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without parental supervision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , balloons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wers .
St@@ range ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ ym FY@@ ROM ( Former Yu@@ go@@ slav Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ kov@@ n@@ ip@@ op@@ lat@@ k@@ y.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association , La@@ isse@@ z F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned absur@@ d@@ ities , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU stip@@ ulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic thereafter exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mush@@ room pre@@ serves , which incurred a high penalty .
The poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of al@@ locating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
" We are handic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a refund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jaro@@ slav Pal@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) .
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cere@@ als , and due to the so-called buy-@@ out interventions , the state 's w@@ are@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s .
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cere@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Funding to subsidi@@ se funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pavel N@@ eme@@ c ( US-@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re legislation is the exception
Regul@@ ations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ mo@@ tions fl@@ are among Cze@@ chs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular lab@@ elling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
The Cze@@ chs fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the lab@@ elling of their Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ zem@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be renamed tu@@ zem@@ ak by the manufacturers .
The appell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products dist@@ illed from cane sugar , and not sugar be@@ et .
Carls@@ bad waf@@ ers , Po@@ ho@@ reli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hop@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world-@@ renowned fet@@ a cheese and gor@@ g@@ onz@@ ola , German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lu@@ beck , and Par@@ ma ham .
The EU 's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice g@@ inger@@ bread and Hor@@ icky tubes .
People want me to save the republic , but I am an amateur , says Ok@@ amura
Senator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a senator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past tw@@ enty years , thieves roaming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned for@@ ty , and I am an independent non-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president .
You have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate 's elections .
Later , I added that if I were elected as senator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
Therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television , but that we tr@@ ample anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , misleading the public , and mist@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was allegedly bri@@ bing reporters , or I was allegedly an advisor of J@@ iri Par@@ ou@@ bek .
Let 's talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial disclosure of assets over tw@@ enty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve this ?
When I lobbied , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ ab@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
As an independent non-@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech view@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get angry when someone calls you a populist .
Are you not confirming this with what you have stated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it popul@@ ism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the Attorney General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an amateur , I am not a genius or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ amura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acquain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cur@@ a , who declined due to his work@@ load .
So I , at least , support investigative journalist , Jana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ va , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts .
Six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the sen@@ ate , there are only two independents , including me .
People have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial disclosures , but what is yours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million , a Skoda Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the Aston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was g@@ all@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ iny .
You drive an Aston Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not inspire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay .
As I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
For example , my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a Samar@@ it@@ an , who saves the Republic .
But I must also live off something .
As a businessman , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can be read in Saturday 's issue of Pra@@ vo .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently erected Büch@@ er@@ berg ( literally " book mountain " ) - 2 photos
" I think the building is fun , looks futur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , " said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a pas@@ ser-@@ by at the road@@ -@@ side .
And Stefan Sper@@ mon , IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented : " It 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . "
However , I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age .
Everyone has the Internet , an iP@@ ad and e@@ Books .
No-@@ one goes into one of these old-@@ style libraries voluntarily now@@ adays , or am I wrong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ epy town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record-@@ holder .
The 80,@@ 000-@@ resident munici@@ p@@ ality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
In order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recre@@ ate the seven fic@@ t@@ itious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
The success of the education offensive was limited .
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Ro@@ tter@@ dam@@ -based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of aud@@ acious bar charts and producer of hum@@ orous and often cynical buildings , took the project on with his customary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face .
And with the judging panel still looking at him with bewil@@ der@@ ment , shr@@ ug@@ ging their shoulders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as stacked his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a py@@ ramid and rounded off his presentation - now su@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : " Dear Munici@@ p@@ ality ! "
So this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Mountain - for the so-called Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg !
Nine years later , the 30-@@ million-@@ euro mountain has been lifted up .
It is part of a re@@ vit@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terr@@ aced houses , with a total of 50 dwell@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the Büch@@ er@@ berg was awarded second place in the " Best Library of NL 2012 " competition .
In addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
Thus , the fac@@ eless small-@@ town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-@@ modern pedestrian area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ugly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
First and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
The long journey to the book
The first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books beneath a cheese dome .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the top@@ ography on foot .
The interior space , gla@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamp@@ s speak the un@@ mistak@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban ambi@@ ance is perfect .
You are already on the look@@ out for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
And everywhere there are books , books , books .
" Normally book shelves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unpleasant and im@@ personal , " says Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
We turned the classical spati@@ al con@@ figuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The interior of the Büch@@ er@@ berg is clever@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a chess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ adding , parap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the stair@@ way .
The appearance , feel and scent are foreign .
Even die-@@ hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials .
" Here we wanted to work with rec@@ ycl@@ able materials , " explained J@@ oop Troub@@ or@@ st , Project Manager for the Munici@@ p@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm .
For many years , milli@@ met@@ re-@@ thick artificial fabric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
It is inexpensive and saves time .
The thin tex@@ tile lasts for two seasons and is then di@@ sposed of as bulk waste .
For the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-@@ cen@@ timet@@ re-@@ thick boards .
Under heat and pressure , the so-called Land@@ bou@@ w plastic ( K@@ LP ) changes colour to a dark , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers .
After 105 steps you have reached the summit .
At the end of the 500-@@ me@@ ter-@@ long journey , you are rewarded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ ettes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
These provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air hum@@ idity in the literary mountain range .
Don@@ ations for the new soul
" You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a showcase project in the area of ec@@ ology , " said Troub@@ or@@ st .
It is heated and cool@@ ed using geo@@ thermal heat .
Although the Büch@@ er@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only sh@@ ines only briefly into the interior , even on sunny days .
The broad , lam@@ inated wood glu@@ e beams positioned at right-@@ angles to the glass fac@@ ade , provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight .
The indoor temperature is very pleasant .
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blin@@ ds .
Stefan Sper@@ mon , initially a scep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library .
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited already .
So too has TC@@ M-@@ teacher , Cynthia Bog@@ arde , who even refers to the Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse 's " long overdue soul . "
The reason : At the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
This was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items .
The concept has been a success .
The shelves are full to capacity .
" Nothing is worse than a half-@@ empty library , " said architect Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
" I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it 's just for dec@@ oration .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in master@@ ing the master discipline that specialist j@@ arg@@ on refers to as the formation of identity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written literary history .
However young and un@@ educated it may be .
This is ultimately a starting point for identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o : " Germans must play a greater role "
In the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany ab@@ stained from voting .
According to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US-@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche W@@ elle : At the beginning of the week , Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for observer status within the United Nations .
However , Berlin subsequently ab@@ stained from voting .
Why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
Now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cautious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel .
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany like@@ wise ab@@ stained from voting , when it came to establishing a no-@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NATO .
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed policy .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accustomed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a " more normal " foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy ent@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East .
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Therefore it must be careful not to aff@@ ront the public , but also the elite in the Arabic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I wouldn 't want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . This is not an entirely one-@@ sided relationship .
Nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's considerations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by ab@@ st@@ aining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position pre@@ v@@ ails .
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
After all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
Due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secretly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u 's policies .
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed European position .
This is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject .
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti-@@ German feelings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
From this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually dimin@@ ishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c '@@ est la vie !

" Brand protection " in China : When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-@@ famous brand , Polo Ralph Lauren like@@ wise .
However , what is Armani Polo ?
Behind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
Nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual creators of the names do not sue .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
" It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , " said Thomas Patt@@ loch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ essing law firm , who speci@@ alises in copyright infringement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my desk .
All the cop@@ yc@@ ats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gucci , Pra@@ da@@ -K@@ ny is registered in place of Prada .
German companies are also ' legally ' cop@@ ied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting apparel , Puma .
Patt@@ loch opens a file containing regist@@ rations with the trademark office in Pe@@ king .
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Ze@@ gn@@ a DF Puma there , an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Ze@@ gn@@ a .
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in cop@@ ying and infr@@ inging on intellectual property is well-known .
In the major cities there are multi-@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ feit goods almost exclusively .
Patt@@ loch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call this " Bang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , " a passenger brand .
The word is based on " Bang Dak@@ uan . "
This refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing .
" This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , " challenges Patt@@ loch .
" The brand is wat@@ ered down , its uni@@ qu@@ eness disappe@@ ars - the image damage is enormous . "
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products .
According to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
However , the del@@ e@@ tion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
Patt@@ loch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ misses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the obj@@ ection is being raised has become a " market reality . "
If the complain@@ ant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pl@@ agi@@ ar@@ ist money for having infr@@ inged on his trademark in China , said Patt@@ loch .
Sometimes the law of the jungle pre@@ v@@ ails here .
Fam@@ ous cases also relate to graphic elements .
In 2009 , Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putz@@ meister .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emble@@ m that resembles the Mercedes star .
Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purch@@ aser Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that re@@ se@@ mbled the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it .
Fashion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against cop@@ yc@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous crocodi@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing .
The C@@ TM@@ O trademark office in Pe@@ king does acknowledge that there were bott@@ len@@ ecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things reportedly " returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . "
Thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
Almost 57@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
Nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office .
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the C@@ TM@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , tot@@ alling 5.5 million in number .
In 2011 , 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received .
Put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 280 yuan , or 160 euros .
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Freu@@ denberg .
For more than seven years , the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pl@@ agi@@ ar@@ ist .
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company 's illegal manufacturing of cop@@ ied motor vehicle parts .
However , the cop@@ yc@@ at still secured the Chinese rights to the Freu@@ denberg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Hann@@ o W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Freu@@ denberg Chemical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
The C@@ TM@@ O trademark office then also dismissed the Mun@@ ich@@ -based company 's appeal .
In the next two instances , Freu@@ denberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
You have to pay extremely careful attention .
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the professionalism of the courts .
However , he also says : " The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and nerves . "
The internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through cent@@ ury-@@ old records in order to provide proof .
Five years ago Freu@@ denberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a " high six-@@ figure sum in euros " as settlement .
" This shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe .
Par@@ tic@@ ularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure un@@ protected brand names there .
For example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freu@@ denberg label for shoes and leather in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration .
" You have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Both he and Patt@@ loch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register " everything " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee .
In actual fact : if Freu@@ denberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Or altern@@ atively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
World AIDS day : St@@ om@@ p , sing , help
In Heidelberg , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i choir is rehear@@ sing - and in the Sw@@ az@@ iland , AIDS orph@@ ans are delighted .
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,7@@ 33 kilometres .
First of all , the st@@ amping : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
One-@@ two-@@ three-@@ four .
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - al@@ to , bass , tenor and sop@@ rano surge , be@@ gu@@ ile and ha@@ unt .
And F@@ ie@@ te Hop@@ f , the 29-year-old conductor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth , yet wild gestures .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heidelberg the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i Cho@@ ir are pract@@ ising a new song .
The fif@@ teen singers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tic@@ ists to the maintenance man .
" O@@ m '@@ Ob@@ ani " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Zul@@ u , which is spoken by el@@ even million people in South Africa , Botswana , Les@@ o@@ th@@ o , Malawi , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and in parts of Sw@@ az@@ iland .
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the estim@@ ations of Un@@ ai@@ ds , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 23.@@ 5 million live in South Africa .
In Sw@@ az@@ iland , there are 24@@ 5,000 AIDS orph@@ ans .
Meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
The Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orph@@ ans in the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i .
70 of these attend a secondary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a sponsor .
This guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the G@@ ogo Centre .
In Zul@@ u , Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i means story@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
In this region , no-one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the choir has been pract@@ ising songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8,@@ 73@@ 3-@@ kilomet@@ re flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the Sw@@ az@@ iland Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir .
For@@ ty percent are infected .
Around 2,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw h@@ uts , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succum@@ bed to the HIV virus .
In E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i you get a small fo@@ resha@@ dow of the illness from which all of Sw@@ az@@ iland is suffering : according to Unicef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world .
Circ@@ um@@ c@@ ision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely pract@@ ised by the population .
More than for@@ ty percent of people in the Sw@@ az@@ iland carry the immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus , and dying in you mid-@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Cho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
Without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
However , just one year later , the choir established the " Vo@@ ices for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level .
Fac@@ ts on sexually transmitted infections .
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases ?
Bac@@ ter@@ ial ST@@ Is include sy@@ ph@@ ilis , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
Common viral ST@@ Is are HIV , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ ital@@ is and hepatitis .
Cr@@ abs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the paras@@ itic ST@@ Is .
Who are the main affected groups ?
Sy@@ ph@@ ilis and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men .
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all sy@@ ph@@ ilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
Among hetero@@ sexual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections , tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ asis , can@@ di@@ di@@ asis ( fung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea and human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among hetero@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group .
Among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
How has the number of infections developed ?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fi@@ able .
According to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of sy@@ ph@@ ilis infections has more than doubled from 1,6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases .
This is around one tenth fewer than the previous year .
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease ?
The infectious diseases can cause ul@@ cers in the gen@@ ital area , discomfort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower abdominal pain and bli@@ sters or warts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining un@@ detected .
How can you protect yourself ?
Con@@ doms can reduce the risk of contr@@ action , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because occasionally , the path@@ o@@ gens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact .
Therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations .
If diagnosed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be c@@ ured and long-term consequences avoided .
Through sp@@ ons@@ or@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
" In total , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , " said Annette Lenn@@ ar@@ tz , Chair@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self-@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , manages the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the orph@@ ans have good accommodation , for example with one of their grand@@ mothers .
The Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Zul@@ u , are the p@@ ill@@ ars of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctu@@ ally every day , in their school uniforms .
Anyone who doesn 't have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with Kh@@ any@@ is@@ ile , a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two coo@@ ks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day .
In addition , " Vo@@ ices for Africa " has established a se@@ wing school , built two chicken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , PS@@ I , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wives
" AIDS is an absolute t@@ aboo subject , " said Annette Lenn@@ ar@@ tz , " because it is associated with sexuality . "
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
The last absolute monarch of sub@@ -Sah@@ aran Africa , King M@@ sw@@ ati III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
Poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
Among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle .
Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country .
There are free condoms on every corner , said Annette Lenn@@ ar@@ tz , " but they are hardly used .
The culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - flesh to flesh . "
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of melanchol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-@@ esteem , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid .
A bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some gri@@ m-@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few tears .
The journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , where the singers visit their sponsor children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well-known in the valley of the E@@ z@@ ul@@ wen@@ i River .
" Go to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , that 's where the light is , " say the people there .
And if you make the 8,@@ 73@@ 3-@@ kilomet@@ re flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the stom@@ ping singers in their rehearsal room , you 'll see that the light is there too .
Messen@@ ger : NASA dis@@ covers ice on Mercury
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury .
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency , NASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury .
Although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine " Science . "
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow .
This is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ timet@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
The water presumably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that impacted with Mercury .
However , no-one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Sci@@ entist for the Messen@@ ger probe , Sean Solomon .
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Celsius .
That said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
Un@@ known to the majority of the Earth 's inhabitants , there are probes , teles@@ cop@@ es and small robots such as the Phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe .
From time to time , they trans@@ mit images to Earth : small pe@@ ep@@ holes into the infin@@ ite expan@@ se .
This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute .
The eight planets of our solar system , plus the d@@ war@@ f planet Cer@@ es .
Like Plu@@ to , which or@@ bits around the sun behind Nep@@ tune , Cer@@ es is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astron@@ om@@ ical Union in 2006 .
This image section from an infra@@ red recording by the Spitzer telescope shows a " family portrait " of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue do@@ ts , while more difficult to identify are the pin@@ k-@@ coloured " new-@@ bor@@ ns " in the star delivery room .
This star-@@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassi@@ op@@ ei@@ a con@@ stellation , at a distance of 6,@@ 500 light years away .
This sh@@ immer@@ ing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA 's Spitzer telescope .
The don@@ ut@@ -@@ shaped ring consists of material , ejected by the star in the process of dying .
In the huge Tri@@ f@@ id Neb@@ ula , 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Earth , new stars are created from gas and dust .
NASA 's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the gal@@ actic delivery room .
The P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster , also referred to as " The Seven Sisters , " can be seen with the bare eye at night .
With the telescope , however , the colours really come into their own .
In this infra@@ red photo , the Hel@@ ix Neb@@ ula looks back at the observer like a red eye .
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquar@@ ius con@@ stellation .
Its simil@@ arity with the continent resulted in this Neb@@ ula acquiring the title ' North America ' .
A combination of normal and infra@@ red photography produced the spectacular colour@@ ing .
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spitzer telescope 's infra@@ red detec@@ tors .
Saturn and its rings : How these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astron@@ omy .
Perhaps they are the remnants of a moon of Saturn , which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago .
One of the largest and sharp@@ est pictures from the Hubble telescope : the Wh@@ irl@@ pool Galaxy
De@@ pending on the colour@@ ing , photographs of spiral galax@@ ies can become genuine works of art .
The photograph published by the European Southern Observ@@ atory shows the Tri@@ f@@ id Neb@@ ula in the Sag@@ it@@ tar@@ ius con@@ stellation , several thousand light years away .
The name Tri@@ f@@ id stems from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birth@@ place of stars into three parts .
In the O@@ ph@@ i@@ uch@@ us con@@ stellation , astron@@ omers have photographed the signs of a cosm@@ ic collision : 400 million light years from the earth , the co@@ res of two mer@@ ging galax@@ ies move rapidly towards one another , destined to colli@@ de .
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M@@ 83 spiral galax@@ y .
Anyone who doesn 't like technical ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its nickname , the Southern Catherine Whe@@ el .
The photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Neb@@ ula in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us con@@ stellation .
The ne@@ bul@@ a , 1,400 light years away , consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust .
This image was put together from the X-ray images captured by various teles@@ cop@@ es .
It shows a ring of black holes , 430 million light years away from the Earth .
This group of galax@@ ies , named Ar@@ p 273 , was pictured for NASA by the Hubble space telescope .
Scientists call the larger spiral galax@@ y U@@ GC 18@@ 10 .
This star ne@@ bul@@ a is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Mil@@ ky Way .
This ' star cra@@ dle ' continually produces new youngsters .
Like@@ wise , this star cloud , connected to the Ro@@ set@@ te Neb@@ ula , continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth .
In this bright shining galax@@ y with one small black hole , there exists no dust - only gas .
Researchers pre@@ su@@ me that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang , when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen .
Our view of the universe : the most important teles@@ cop@@ es
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Lip@@ per@@ hey - even before Galileo Gal@@ il@@ ei used the device to observe the stars one year later .
Since then , the mirrors in optical teles@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound .
For a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , the Hale telescope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Observ@@ atory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world .
The mirror , shown in the image , had a di@@ ameter of five metres .
Arizona , USA , is home to the Large Bin@@ oc@@ ular Telescope .
It enables views of space via two mirrors , each with a di@@ ameter of 8.4 metres .
The inner work@@ ings of the Gran Teles@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ar@@ ias on the Can@@ arian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a di@@ ameter of 10.4 metres .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs .
In spite of this it achie@@ ves a di@@ ameter of around el@@ even metres .
The disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method : the telescope is sec@@ urely cl@@ amped at its angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited .
The Hob@@ by Eber@@ ly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation .
What sets it apart : the high light-@@ gathering capacity .
This - in spite of its compar@@ atively low mirror di@@ ameter - even matches that of the world 's largest refle@@ c@@ tor teles@@ cop@@ es .
With the help of a radio telescope in Are@@ ci@@ bo ( Puerto Rico ) researchers can listen for ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial signals in space .
The radio telescope has a di@@ ameter of 305 metres .
In the " Search for Ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial Intelligence " ( SE@@ TI ) every computer owner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available .
View of the European Southern Observ@@ atory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chil@@ ean An@@ des .
This is home to the Very Large Telescope , which lives up to its name .
With its total of four mirrors , the telescope can also focus on the medi@@ al infra@@ red spectrum .
Like@@ wise to be located at the ES@@ O Observ@@ atory in Chile , the European Extrem@@ ely Large Telescope is also being planned .
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
However , images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest .
Until 2007 , the two K@@ eck teles@@ cop@@ es at the Hawaiian volcano , Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
They each have two mirrors , each with a di@@ ameter of ten meters .
The K@@ eck Teles@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a Observ@@ atory , which alongside the K@@ eck teles@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Sub@@ aru telescope and the IR@@ TT@@ F .
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , with a mirror di@@ ameter of thir@@ ty metres .
Here you can mar@@ vel at an artist 's impression .
However , the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope .
Since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 the Ke@@ pler space telescope has been searching for extra-@@ solar planets , especially for any that may be inhab@@ itable .
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,2@@ 35 plan@@ etary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ pler space telescope .
The James Webb Space Telescope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ ane@@ 5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest .
The primary mirror of the infra@@ red space telescope has a di@@ ameter of 6.5 metres .
One of the telescope 's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galax@@ ies that emerged after the Big Bang .
Scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury 's south pole .
However , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messen@@ ger or@@ bits around the planets much closer to the north pole .
For decades , radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury .
Thanks to the Messen@@ ger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mercury , scientists can now be certain .
Drink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age
In Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach bib@@ lical ages .
There is even a museum of longevity .
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
In Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach ages that can almost be considered bib@@ lical .
There is even a museum of longevity .
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
The journey through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic .
The min@@ ibus ru@@ mb@@ les over the winding streets , past den@@ sely woo@@ ded hills , raging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
Every@@ where is green and lush - you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
However , this is the deep south of Azerbaijan , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
This is the home of the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
The final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
The small town is bursting with over@@ powering architecture from Soviet times , which doesn 't fit with the pictu@@ res@@ que mountain landscape at all .
Tour@@ ists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azerbaijan 's capital city , Bak@@ u , is too ar@@ du@@ ous .
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track .
The fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank , has not yet arrives here in the province .
Yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
" Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , " said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
She is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ ge@@ vity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
Here the lives of eight dozen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black & white photo .
This here is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 136 he fa@@ thered another child .
However , the un@@ riv@@ alled star of the museum is shep@@ herd Sh@@ ir@@ ali Mus@@ li@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this .
And given that the longest confirmed lif@@ esp@@ an was 122 years of age , Mus@@ li@@ mo@@ v 's claim seems extremely doubtful .
" He was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , " explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
The man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ thered another daughter at the age of 136 .
So did Sh@@ ir@@ ali Mus@@ li@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ?
But R@@ embr@@ andt Sch@@ ol@@ z , researcher on ageing at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute in Rostock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
" A stri@@ k@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , " said Sch@@ ol@@ z , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sar@@ din@@ ia . "
Due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth regist@@ ers .
Mel@@ ted butter by the glass , every day
However , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bib@@ lical age with striking regul@@ arity .
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
So why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
The Azer@@ i travel guide Far@@ id Mu@@ g@@ im@@ z@@ adeh explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh genetics .
In contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet .
However the notion that the cal@@ or@@ ie-@@ rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of mel@@ ted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? In C@@ en@@ gem@@ ir@@ an , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Rub@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
At 97 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 143 desc@@ endants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
She sits on the floor with a butter ch@@ urn , which she rolls backwards and forwards ti@@ rel@@ essly .
Eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time .
There are also two small children running around .
In the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Ar@@ mad@@ u glasses .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her head@@ scarf she conce@@ als long , dark blond pla@@ its , which her son proudly reveals for us .
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
" I have never used sham@@ po@@ o either , " said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
Mon@@ thly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes , potatoes , pe@@ as .
My whole life I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket .
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
However , everything became better when the " beloved father " Hey@@ dar Ali@@ yev took the ru@@ dder .
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
Yet the cult that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan .
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
At least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijan 's elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
And perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's long gre@@ ying son is right : " The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . "
They live among their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy .
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
The notion of " human rights " is om@@ itted from the constitution .
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
Comp@@ eting demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country .
The future constitution based on Shar@@ ia law is fiercely disputed .
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion .
We must make the transition .
" And making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , " he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liberals , en@@ ligh@@ tened Muslims and sec@@ ular@@ ists .
For all of them , until now hop@@ el@@ essly estranged in a bewil@@ dered opposition , are fearful .
They are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brother@@ hood .
According to Mohamed M@@ urs@@ i , speaking almost ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , " in order to rescue the revolution . "
However , Egyp@@ tians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1-year-old engineer who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
Should the judiciary be deprived of power ?
In actual fact , the 234 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic-@@ dominated 1@@ 10-@@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the " principles of Islamic law . "
Yet what are " principles " ?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the wo@@ olly form@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeu@@ vre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Shar@@ ia law .
This is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Shar@@ ia law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam .
This can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation , which would result in the de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judiciary .
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld .
During Mubarak 's rule , these courts served to suppress opposition .
Following the fall of the dictator , up to 11,000 civilians were under military imprisonment .
According to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its mor@@ als and values . "
From a legal perspective , this is form@@ ulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinem@@ atic art and literature .
In plain language , this is nothing other than censorship .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , no article explicitly establ@@ ishes the equality of men and women .
Another does prohibit the insult or s@@ lander of the prophe@@ t Mohamed and his em@@ iss@@ aries .
However , what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear .
Equ@@ ally dubious is the form@@ ulation stating that " insulting people " is forbidden .
Is a car@@ ic@@ ature of the president sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ?
Open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by M@@ urs@@ i to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyp@@ tians for referendum " very soon . "
" The revolution is back "
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists .
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Square in Cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
" The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ torious , " said Ham@@ din Sab@@ b@@ ahi , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed El-@@ Bar@@ adei explained that the constitutional draft belongs " on the rubbish tip of history . "
Via SMS service Twitter , he accused M@@ urs@@ i 's followers of wanting to lead " a coup against democracy . "
" If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and overthrow him , " said member of the opposition J@@ asser Said .
" We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been at@@ oned for , " stated the Egyptian media , quoting opposition politician Ch@@ aled Ali .
And several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum , which would render it inv@@ al@@ id .
" The Koran is our constitution "
The well-@@ organised Muslim Brother@@ hood gathered for a counter-@@ demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile , outside the Cairo University .
Many ve@@ iled women and followers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , shouting out : " The people demand the application of God 's law . "
They demanded of M@@ urs@@ i : " Cle@@ an@@ se the country ! " and protested : " The Koran is our constitution . "
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events ver@@ ging on civil war .
Quite clearly , this was something that M@@ urs@@ i 's followers did not want to risk .
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists ' draft .
" The term ' human rights ' does not even appear once "
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is furious about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 48@@ -year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Brother@@ hood , when imprisoned or in court under Mubarak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indi@@ visible .
For this he was battered , condemned and imprisoned .
" And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he be@@ mo@@ aned in a discussion with " W@@ elt am Sonntag . "
The lawyer has resigned himself to M@@ urs@@ i extending his power to all three branches of state government .
These measures are blat@@ ant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship .
" Instead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspending it , " complained Sa@@ eda .
Yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement .
This could come back to ha@@ unt them .
One demonstr@@ ator at the Tah@@ ri@@ r warned : " You are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . "
Norway 's rak@@ fis@@ k : Is this the world 's sm@@ el@@ liest fish ?
Norway 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
Could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local appetite for some exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ elly fish ?
Take a selection of over-@@ ripe chees@@ es .
Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty , wet soccer kit .
Leave for a week .
Now you have the no@@ se-@@ num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwegian delic@@ acies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
There is snow , spectacular scen@@ ery - and that od@@ our , ever present , hangs in the air .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut sprin@@ kled with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flock to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
" You eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , " says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full-time local firefighter but also the so-called " Rak@@ fis@@ k General , " in charge of running the festival .
All around us people are eating little cub@@ es of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
" Some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , " says Hav@@ ard .
The drink can kill the smell .
I try a few pieces .
If you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , pover@@ ty-@@ stricken times in Norway when , pre-@@ refriger@@ ation , fish was soaked in air@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
Then in the depths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
Only a generation ago , thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , emig@@ rating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
People from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as sign@@ ifying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ elly part of Norway 's past .
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
People here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders Brei@@ vi@@ k , the right-wing , racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
Instead , the shootings are referred to as " the July the 22nd incident . "
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-@@ loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder .
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway 's present@@ -@@ day wealth .
" But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says Anna our wait@@ ress , handing round tra@@ ys of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long blond hair and start@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well-being .
We are a - how you say - prudent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ lawless .
We are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound .
" As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , " says Anna .
" And eat rak@@ fis@@ k , " she adds with a care@@ free laugh .
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .
Now an el@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather succ@@ ul@@ ent to the taste .
But in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ elly fish .
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
There is a live TV link up to a com@@ per@@ e in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k .
It is like the Eurovision song contest .
" What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or-@@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? "
" Here are our points , Hav@@ ard . "
There is cl@@ apping , laughter .
A man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it .
Or maybe it is the fum@@ es from all that fish .
Mexico 's Enri@@ que Pena Nie@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico 's incoming President Enri@@ que Pena Nie@@ to prepares to take office , the BBC 's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
A congest@@ ed city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
The aim , however , wasn 't to stop commuters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico 's new president Enri@@ que Pena Nie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
He faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
" My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , " Mr Pena Nie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
Before rub@@ bing shoulders with the US president , Mr Pena Nie@@ to 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A populous , sprawling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stom@@ ping ground .
A straightforward man
In the bu@@ co@@ lic town of V@@ alle del Bravo , for example , he is remembered fon@@ dly .
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nie@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cracked and b@@ ump@@ y roads it replaced .
Pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
" We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ ver@@ a Hernandez , a state congressman for Mr Pena Nie@@ to 's party , the PR@@ I .
Par@@ tic@@ ularly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
After an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ousted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fox .
Congressman Ol@@ ver@@ a admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expectation within the party about Enri@@ que Pena Nie@@ to .
And he rejects the opposition 's character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
He 's a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He 's an excellent stat@@ esman and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
In Ne@@ z@@ ah@@ u@@ alco@@ yo@@ tl , also known as Ciudad Ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ bbled streets of V@@ alle del Bravo couldn 't be shar@@ per .
Tu@@ cked away under motorway fl@@ yo@@ vers , it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the munici@@ p@@ ality are also gritty and urban .
Earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbour@@ hoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
On a patch of wast@@ eland by a vast landfill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nie@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synon@@ ymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr Pena Nie@@ to 's critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ icide while he was in office .
At worst , they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the rund@@ own neighbourhood , Ir@@ ine@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mar@@ iana L@@ una .
According to the official version of events , Mar@@ iana committed suicide in 2010 .
However her family believes she was murdered by her partner .
" When I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , " Sen@@ ora Bu@@ en@@ dia recalls .
There were signs she 'd been beaten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
As her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mar@@ iana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice .
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old gossip , a troub@@ le-@@ maker , a wh@@ iner .
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and sh@@ uts up .
" But that can 't be right when there were so many irregularities and om@@ is@@ sions , " she says .
As President Pena Nie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
" I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , " says PR@@ I Congressman Ol@@ ver@@ a in V@@ alle del Bravo .
That , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ciudad Ne@@ za most fear .
Bradley Manning didn 't complain about mistre@@ at@@ ment , prosecutors contend
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning 's claims of abuse in confinement
The hearing focuses on Manning 's time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning 's confinement was harsh
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistre@@ at@@ ment he 's alleging he suffered in military custody .
While cross-@@ examining Manning at a pre-@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Maryland , prosecutor Maj. Ash@@ den Fein asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
The cross-@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Manning 's case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
The Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks .
Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information .
In Friday 's hearing , Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses .
When Fein asked about the forms Friday , Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . "
The forms show no complaints of mistre@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment , Fein contended .
Manning responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn 't record the issues .
" They would write down ' no issues ' ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn 't necessarily mean I didn 't bring something up , " Manning said .
The judge , Army Col. Denise L@@ ind , also asked Manning why he didn 't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injury " status downgraded .
The military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
" I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my view@@ point , " Manning said .
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia in July 2010 .
He said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ ressing .
" My world just shrink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that cage , " Manning said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that cage .
Once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Manning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Manning said he was allowed only a matt@@ ress , blanket , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his glasses .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
Manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Manning 's lawyer filed a formal obj@@ ection to Manning 's treatment in January 2011 .
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , Kansas , in April 2011 .
Also Friday , the judge asked Manning about an allegation that he made in Thursday 's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cell , he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he in@@ ferred from his guard 's order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn 't a danger to himself .
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his underwear or his fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps to hurt himself but hadn 't done so .
That night , Manning testified , his underwear , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and glasses were removed from his cell .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court-@@ martial , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted .
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um-@@ custody detainees at Qu@@ an@@ tico .
Coun@@ ts against Manning include aiding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
If he 's convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
My Mexic@@ an-@@ American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mexicans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mexicans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ arre@@ tte says Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ umped .
Signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " Mexic@@ an@@ os " ( " Mexicans " ) , another for " Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os " ( " Fore@@ igners . " )
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
Growing up in Central California , I had been called a " Mexican " my entire life .
It 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . "
Later , I settled on " Mexic@@ an-@@ American . "
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
But I don 't have the voc@@ ab@@ ulary of a native , and I can 't shake my American accent .
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican pre@@ sident-@@ elect Enri@@ que Pena Nie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
Pena Nie@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Uni@@ on-@@ style trading bloc in North America .
And Pena Nie@@ to vowed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug cartels , even though he offered no specifics .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
But for Mexicans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexican press , and among the el@@ ites -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ aching upon their neighbor 's sovereignty .
And the children of Monte@@ zum@@ a go on the war@@ path .
And yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard feelings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn 't .
The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancest@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
We 're their offspring , and we 're loyal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American Dream we 're living , and not the Mexican one .
Our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zzy , but our loyalty is clear .
It 's to the United States .
Besides , we 're aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don 't like us .
The feeling is mutual .
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as infer@@ ior stock that isn 't sufficiently Mexican .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
Our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families hadn 't failed in Mexico , they wouldn 't have left .
And we wouldn 't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost soul@@ s nonetheless .
My wife , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans because Mexicans have a fir@@ mer grasp of who they are and Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans res@@ ent that .
While she 's a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
Meanwhile , many Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either .
We love listening to the Mexican band , Los Tig@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bruce Springsteen .
You get the best of both worlds , but you 're rooted in neither .
In Mexico , we 're seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we 're considered Mexican .
Now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and parts of the intellig@@ ent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
They want to put Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans to work as makeshift " ambassadors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
Yeah .
That 's not going to happen .
Too many hard feelings .
And , with income ine@@ quality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I 'm afraid you 're on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
That 's fair .
If at least some Mexicans aren 't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexic@@ an-@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ mm@@ m .
Maybe we 're more " Mexican " than I thought .
Old battles , new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain .
Amid the usual fut@@ ile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel 's metro@@ polis , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
Maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ dier than before .
However , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now .
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaza 's 1.@@ 7m people in one of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crowded corners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
Moreover , Hamas 's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
Jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islamist c@@ rescent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hiz@@ bul@@ lah part@@ y-@@ c@@ um-@@ militia holds sway , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bash@@ ar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are men@@ acing the king .
Above all , on Israel 's southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Brother@@ hood under President Muhammad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the Brother@@ hood is a cousin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
Meanwhile , Israel 's hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conclusions .
In military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel 's Iron Dome anti-@@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missiles have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a while .
In diplomatic terms , America is as stead@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Above all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of su@@ ici@@ de-@@ bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that bites into the West Bank , the main chunk of a would-be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Lik@@ ud party has merged with an even more haw@@ k@@ ish lot under Av@@ ig@@ dor Lieberman in the run-up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
Why co@@ d@@ dle those tw@@ ist@@ y Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their compatri@@ ots have done in Gaza ?
Better to keep them behind that wall and s@@ mite them if they raise their heads .
Maybe the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
Starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies .
That the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire aug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
Re@@ pression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demo@@ gra@@ phy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population sw@@ ells .
Bloo@@ dy missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
Both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by outsiders
The answer remains the one trump@@ eted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ce@@ ding territory for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual stat@@ eh@@ ood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he neglected to present his own plan for peace .
Back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
This is wo@@ efully short-@@ sigh@@ ted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
C@@ igare@@ tte plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
Smoking warnings and dise@@ ased body parts em@@ bla@@ z@@ oned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia 's world-@@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand lo@@ gos and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green cover@@ ings , gru@@ esome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small f@@ ont .
It is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia 's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour .
It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
" Even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , " said the federal health minister , T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ sek , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess .
While Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multin@@ ation@@ als ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws .
Tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
" There will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation , " said Scott McIn@@ tyre of British American Tobacco Australia .
Counter@@ feit@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
Others say the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , si@@ licon covers to mask the un@@ pal@@ atable packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco , Britain 's Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court .
H@@ a said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
This is good business for us .
The potential hit@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
" If you are a tobacco mark@@ eter and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , " said Bec@@ ky Freeman , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
Freeman noted an increase in " average Joe " reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
We have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves Marl@@ boro cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-@@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ sek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Tou@@ gher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smokers in Australia remain defiant .
The pictures don 't affect me .
I just ignore them .
" You just grab a smoke and put it away , " said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tum@@ our .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , there 's only one reason I 'd stop , and that 's my little girl .
James Yu , who runs the King of the Pack to@@ bac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
" It used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Yu said .
" The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we 're done , we 'll shut up shop , " he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
In a Con@@ st@@ antly P@@ lu@@ g@@ ge@@ d-@@ In World , It 's Not All Bad to Be Bo@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I won 't lie to you .
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ dious , even with the distr@@ actions of books , magazines and iPhones ( not to mention d@@ ut@@ y-@@ free shopping ) .
But increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
It 's all right for us - and our children - to be bored on occasion , they say .
It forces the brain to go on interesting t@@ ang@@ ents , perhaps fo@@ stering creativity .
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
So should we embrace bo@@ re@@ dom ?
Yes .
And no .
But I 'll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the adv@@ ent of more leisure time .
Not so , says Peter T@@ oo@@ hey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of " Bo@@ re@@ dom : A Li@@ vely History " ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) .
" Bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , " he said .
There 's Latin graffiti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ p@@ ei@@ i dating from the first century .
Then there 's the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
The trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. Eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario , Canada .
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of " wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . "
What separ@@ ates bo@@ re@@ dom from ap@@ athy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With ap@@ athy , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is " disruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . "
Bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an awful lot like depression .
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes we think we 're bored when we just have difficulty concentrating .
In their study , " The Un@@ engaged Mind : Defin@@ ing Bo@@ re@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of At@@ tention , " which appeared in the journal Per@@ spectives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ eable , while the third group didn 't hear the soundtrack at all .
The ones who heard the low-@@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
When you 're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associate professor of neuro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you 're doing something dull , " such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , distr@@ acting music can help you not be bored . "
In fact , he said , we now know that squir@@ ming and d@@ ood@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
" Research shows that kids who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
We all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a dr@@ oning speaker , a particularly te@@ dious movie .
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a " Bo@@ re@@ dom Pr@@ on@@ eness Sc@@ ale " in the 1980s .
The scale includes questions like , " Many things I have to do are re@@ pet@@ itive and mono@@ ton@@ ous , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . "
Using such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ dan@@ ovich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stim@@ ulation .
But in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
In 1991 , Reed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper .
He found that 32 percent of adol@@ escents said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren 't in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bored .
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that " adol@@ escence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , " largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
Sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or indul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
On the other hand , many philosoph@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ ovich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
" Bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N.@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn 't always know the most appropriate thing to do .
If you 're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is bored and you give him an iP@@ ad , he may not be bored anymore , but he hasn 't learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
And " that self-@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said .
Your kid doesn 't just learn to entertain himself , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas .
I don 't think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor Eastwood agreed .
" We frame it as we need to be bored more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an agon@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , " he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
" In an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimul@@ ated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ uts down . "
In Colorado , No Play@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law
Anthony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the plain@@ s near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over .
After the police officer found marijuana in the car , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ mons for possession and drug parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - petty offenses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
" We get treated like criminals , " Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
But is he one ?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado 's vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-@@ scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosecutors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state-@@ licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
" This thing is evolving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Denver .
Regul@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1 , 2013 .
They say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
" Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
" There 's no real precedent for us to follow , " he said .
Washington 's law , called I-@@ 50@@ 2 , takes effect on Dec. 6 , which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
And there are thor@@ ny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mandate of " adequate access " to licensed marijuana with its prohib@@ itions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
" No@@ where will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area , " said Ben Living@@ ston , a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group .
On Nov. 21 , Chief O@@ ates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes " effective immediately . "
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
In northern Colorado 's Wel@@ d County , the district attorney , Ken Buck , represents a stricter view .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
Right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
" Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. Buck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
The police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
The county 's district attorney , Pete Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
" I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , " he said .
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational marijuana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
And the contradic@@ tory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ valence among local officials about the state 's big green experiment .
" It 's a cultural barrier " with district attorneys , said Sean Mc@@ Allister , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
" They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said .
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anx@@ iously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultiv@@ ation of marijuana as federal crimes .
Advoc@@ ates for leg@@ alized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields .
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state-@@ regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before Election Day , some local governments approved mor@@ at@@ ori@@ ums on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six-month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
" We don 't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , " said Bob Nicholson , a City Council member .
Our community voted against this amendment .
We 're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
There 's an awful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella Wy@@ att : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not just today 's university students who are attacked for their views
I can 't remember a time when I didn 't dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a modern-day win@@ e-@@ bl@@ ushed Greek sym@@ posium encouraging the dual p@@ ill@@ ars of civil@@ isation , free thinking and tolerance .
Yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eigh@@ ties to read history , I 'd packed my bags , precip@@ itating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cried .
Friends were baff@@ led .
The Evening Standard diary claimed I 'd quit because I objected to fellow under@@ graduates having sex in the room next to mine .
The writer A N Wilson announced wag@@ g@@ ishly that I 'd departed because I was forced to drink out of chipped mu@@ gs .
The truth was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation .
Not on account of my rather outr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persec@@ uted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both big@@ oted and barbar@@ ic : my father , the late Woo@@ dro@@ w Wy@@ att , was a high-profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter .
Why bring this up now , you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of R@@ ight-@@ of-@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
Such is the institution@@ alised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al-@@ rights protection as gays , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
Conservative members of Cor@@ pus Christ@@ i College 's junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are " often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome " because of their political views .
They want to create a post on the college 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
Their situation wasn 't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , Wonder@@ land : Young , Bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portrayed Tories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo-@@ Nazis .
It featured graduate Joe Cooke , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( O@@ U@@ CA ) , travelling in a Rolls-Royce , sporting a silver suit and sil@@ ver-@@ topped cane .
At other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as " scap@@ ego@@ ats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . "
Luke Black , 20 , vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing Le@@ ft-@@ wing bias at universities .
People assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . "
Samuel Roberts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ pus Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " uncomfortable , " while Stephanie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ U@@ CA , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
" This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly shy 18-year-old .
Hat@@ red of the Conservative Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile .
The year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
The atmosphere would have made a Stal@@ inist sh@@ ud@@ der with appreh@@ en@@ sion .
During the first few days of fresh@@ ers " week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ unting of Tory under@@ graduates but took part with rel@@ ish .
The politics of the miners " strike , privat@@ isation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood-@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
My first one involved trans@@ lating 18@@ th-century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
" Miss Wy@@ att , " said the don , Harry Pitt ( now deceased ) , " please translate the first par@@ agraph . "
I stumbled over it .
A small man with a face like cake batter , Pitt was big on b@@ ile .
" Do That@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? " he demanded .
The other under@@ graduates gig@@ gled .
Te@@ ars pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
" I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you 're not too busy soci@@ alising , " Pitt sn@@ ar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a dis@@ consol@@ ate figure .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a second-@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ CA .
" I know who you are , " he said kin@@ dly .
I 'm afraid it 's like that .
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on .
It 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
Most Tory fresh@@ ers pretend they 're Labour .
Later , at a local pub , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate .
I insisted that I didn 't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said .
This plo@@ y proved unsuccessful .
A first year PP@@ E student , who , iron@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : " You 're the daughter of a fasc@@ ist pig . "
You 're contaminated .
Other students took up the refrain .
I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dirty .
" How do Tories have sex ? " one asked .
They beat each other , don 't they ?
I felt the way homosexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I be forced to meet like-@@ minded people only after dark ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
The three years before me stretched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ str@@ ac@@ ism and isolation .
The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
He was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers .
He was hardly ever there .
He lo@@ athed the place as provincial and petty , and for its adher@@ ence to the Marx@@ ist-@@ determin@@ ist view of history .
In 1997 he took up a prof@@ ess@@ orship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
" You won 't be happy here , " he told me .
I began com@@ mut@@ ing from Oxford to my parents " house in London , finding refuge with my more open-@@ minded metropolitan friends and family .
I told my father I hated Oxford and why .
He was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
During his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
" But it 's the best place in the world , " he said path@@ e@@ tically .
They wouldn 't do that , not among my dre@@ aming spi@@ res .
Even my Communist friends always had imp@@ ec@@ cable man@@ ners .
His r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to cloud .
Give it a chance .
I 'm sure it 's all just a te@@ ase .
It would break my heart if you left .
Ex@@ hau@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
A male friend of mine , also a Tory supporter , had succum@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed .
During a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an " enemy of the people , " I decided to do the same .
In@@ wardly bl@@ ushing with shame , I admitted to being " brain@@ washed by my parents " and called them " old fo@@ ols . "
The resp@@ ite was short .
It was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week .
My door was locked .
I co@@ wered inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
When they left , I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a sn@@ iv@@ elling w@@ im@@ p .
But no 18-year-old should be subject to such intimidation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill-@@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
" Valentino prefers elegan@@ ce to notor@@ iety "
On the occasion of the " Valentino : Master of C@@ outure , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC speaks with Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , Fiona Thys@@ sen-@@ Bor@@ ne@@ mis@@ za and other of the Italian designer 's famous clients .
Somerset House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition .
During the inauguration of " Valentino : Master of C@@ outure , " the designer acknowledged a retro@@ spective a@@ po@@ the@@ osis that brings together over 130 c@@ outure g@@ owns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
" I love this palace " he says , in his un@@ mistak@@ able Italian accent .
This exhibition is the culmin@@ ation of a story whose only pro@@ tagon@@ ist is " sign@@ ore " Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients .
Valentino has always been fascinated by the ra@@ re@@ fied and distant world of the no@@ bility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of arist@@ ocr@@ acy , from Princess Sal@@ im@@ ah Ag@@ a Khan , Lord Snow@@ don , Princess Mar@@ ie-@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Margaret of England .
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social as@@ cent from humble cou@@ tur@@ ier in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ dol of the international jet@@ -@@ set .
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty .
" At least they don 't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some beautiful pop music celebrities do , " says Baroness Fiona Thys@@ sen-@@ Bor@@ ne@@ mis@@ za .
In the ' 60s and ' 70s , we both lived in the Al@@ ps and were good friends .
Valentino is a spectacular host whose enter@@ tains with generosity and elegan@@ ce .
" We all loved being invited to his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad " says " Hein@@ i " Thys@@ sen 's ex-wife , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as M@@ are@@ lla Agn@@ elli and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Valentino has always preferred elegan@@ ce to notor@@ iety .
And yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Ma@@ zza , wearing a Valentino .
The Argentine model Val@@ eria Ma@@ zza also recalls the cou@@ tur@@ ier 's charis@@ ma .
Many years ago , after a fashion show in Pi@@ azza di Sp@@ ag@@ na in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
There were tw@@ enty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
You could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its dec@@ or , the food and the music .
" All the guests were made to feel important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te C@@ outure Week Paris , in 1995 .
" His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she concludes .
Nob@@ ility parade
Gar@@ av@@ ani 's life is not a story of obsession , but of well re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ated love .
He loves well-@@ educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him .
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous , six@@ ty-@@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role reversal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream " audience " wearing Valentino master@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Ari@@ sto@@ tle On@@ assis , the costume Monica Vit@@ ti wore in " La No@@ tte " and the w@@ ool and leather coat that belonged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ ba .
In this crowd of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as S@@ ib@@ illa of Luxembourg , Gloria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , Met@@ te-@@ Mar@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ ario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Hab@@ sburg .
Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . "
I remember it perfectly .
It was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a " gil@@ et " wa@@ ist@@ coat and jacket from the 197@@ 1-@@ 1972 au@@ tum@@ n-@@ winter collection .
" It was a gift he gave me " says Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the designer 's mus@@ es .
" I prefer him to other designers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he enh@@ ances our beauty " added the former Du@@ chess of Fer@@ ia .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your face .
Their proportions are perfect .
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Gi@@ ov@@ amp@@ a@@ ola d '@@ Ar@@ enberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino .
As a teenager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening g@@ owns ...
My time finally came in the late ' 90s .
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
It was a red dress , with a fr@@ illy skirt , draped " cor@@ sage " and a stra@@ pless neck@@ line .
" It was a dream come true " says Princess D '@@ Ar@@ enberg , the widow of Rodri@@ go d '@@ Ar@@ enberg .
" Valentino is in@@ different to fashion , his obsession is tim@@ eless " says this Italian arist@@ oc@@ rat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princess D '@@ Ar@@ enberg looks after her cou@@ tur@@ ier g@@ owns with " the ut@@ most care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many memories that go with it . "
The " king " of fashion
The " grand finale " of the Somerset House exhibition is Mar@@ ie-@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al Miller 's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
It took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l-@@ en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ vor@@ y-@@ coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long .
According to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the return of high society clients . "
Da@@ zzled for years with the " sa@@ vo@@ ir@@ -@@ ê@@ tre " of the elite , Valentino is now its finest exp@@ onent .
Caval@@ iere di Gran Cro@@ ce ( the highest-@@ ranking distinction in Italy ) , Caval@@ iere del La@@ vor@@ o , Comman@@ deur de L '@@ Or@@ dre des Arts et des L@@ ett@@ res , and awarded the Legion of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accum@@ ulates as many honours as any of his clients ' husbands .
" I 've always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his neat and perfect appearance " acknowledges D '@@ Ar@@ enberg .
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum .
He was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jacqueline de R@@ ib@@ es , a great friend of mine .
" He was imm@@ ac@@ ulate , time stands still for him . "
If a princess says that ...
The hardest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen
For four euros , the Indonesian volcano por@@ ters risk life and lim@@ b carrying 70 kil@@ os of sul@@ ph@@ ur along steep stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
This is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ j@@ aya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen volcano , east of the Indonesian island of Java .
To do so , he has to desc@@ end every day to the bottom of the cr@@ ater , where the sul@@ ph@@ uro@@ us gas eman@@ ating from the bow@@ els of the earth solidi@@ fies on contact with air .
After breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kil@@ os , he carries them in two bam@@ boo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2,@@ 38@@ 6 metres above sea level , but the exhausted por@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precip@@ ice .
They know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen cli@@ ffs .
The Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lu@@ gging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the sc@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
This is PT N@@ gri@@ mb@@ i Cand@@ i , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 rupe@@ es ( 5 euro cents ) per kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur .
It then sells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10,000 rupe@@ es ( 83 cents ) to the petro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fireworks , cosme@@ tics , dynam@@ ite and even for wh@@ it@@ ening sugar .
" We generally carry 70 kil@@ os , so we get about 46@@ ,000 rupe@@ es ( 3.8 euros ) a trip " explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8,000 rupe@@ es ( 11.5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pit@@ tance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
" Min@@ ers ' wages are very high here , whereas coffee harvest@@ ing is paid 15,000 rupe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupe@@ es ( 167 euros ) " explains the por@@ ter , who previously worked as a m@@ ason in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 75,000 rupe@@ es ( 6.2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to Ban@@ yu@@ w@@ ang@@ i , a village near the volcano , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur : " I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I 've brought her to Java to convert to Islam . "
An@@ to has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are irrit@@ ated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , An@@ to has been risking his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen volcano , and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and go@@ ggles .
He has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are irrit@@ ated by the toxic gases from the volcano .
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
" I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he vows in more than acceptable English .
Pun@@ ished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tionist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le .
Shar@@ ing a fil@@ thy wooden hut with other por@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur doesn 't stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dark .
Def@@ ying the shadows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the cr@@ ater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
Some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur baskets on their shoulders from the cr@@ ater .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ ur ex@@ traction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the por@@ ters , who work for themselves and by the kil@@ o .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30,000 rupe@@ e ( 2.5 euro ) per camera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15,000 rupe@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mul@@ es .
" This work is for animals , not people " protests Mad@@ r@@ us@@ in , a bur@@ ly 42-@@ year por@@ ter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 110 kil@@ os , ensuring that he will go on working " all he can " because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old .
I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life .
Although the sul@@ ph@@ ur burns your throat and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so har@@ dy that no-one complain@@ s of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis , knee pain and so@@ res on the shoulders , which have been mis@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the baskets .
Bal@@ ancing the basket on his back , Un@@ ain@@ ik can only carry 50 kil@@ os now he is 53 years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the volcano , which three lor@@ ries move to the warehouse in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away along a go@@ at path that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
" I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life " says Un@@ ain@@ ik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
The oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur .
Time passes , but poverty perpetu@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen volcano .
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans blame their careers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
" Singapore 's population needs to grow . "
I 'm a patriotic husband , you 're my patriotic wife , let 's do our civic duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these vers@@ es are part of an advert for min@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " Let 's put a ba@@ o ( bu@@ n ) in the oven " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . "
It 's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and am@@ using .
It 's the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world 's worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perf@@ um@@ es with pher@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn 't necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by compos@@ ing a rap ?
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly .
It spends USD 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child , extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conserv@@ atism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans not having children ?
Tan Wei Ming , Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . "
" This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains .
These changes in social nor@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where x@@ en@@ ophob@@ ia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly disguised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vies for foreign workers .
U@@ nex@@ p@@ ected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote a single-@@ living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses .
But , L@@ im Ye@@ w Soon , managing director of the real estate company EL Develop@@ ers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
" People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
" But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their careers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans have the last word .
What is private offline is private online
Priv@@ acy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy D@@ ic@@ tionary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . "
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and pass@@ word " when applied to social networks .
" I wouldn 't upload my deep@@ est secrets in a post " says Jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hot@@ mail and Windows Live Messen@@ ger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" They are very secret secrets , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says .
On F@@ B I upload nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
" I wouldn 't share a photo that isn 't mine , or that belongs to somebody who 's doing something stupid " he says .
The child recogn@@ ises that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments .
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine followers on Twitter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the pass@@ word to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting twe@@ ets .
" I don 't know if they answer me , I only upload them " he adds .
" Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
He does not hesit@@ ate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This teenager has accounts with Hot@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" It doesn 't bother me , because we have something in common , like music " he says .
The boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
" If they pressured me or asked me for it , I 'd just del@@ ete them from my account " he states .
Joseph became a follow@@ er on Ask , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyber@@ bullying .
An acquain@@ tance of a friend of mine was being pest@@ ered on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
" I never found out who it was " he says .
The victim , according to José , did not close his account .
" He just made it private . "
He then explains a series of steps to con@@ figure the account safely .
Unlike Jorge , this boy would upload photos of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do it if I didn 't like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
" However , I know that 's cyber@@ bullying " he admits .
Key questions
Mar@@ iel@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
" The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed " he says .
Por@@ ras says the scholar Marc P@@ ren@@ sky , with a Master 's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Im@@ migrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Digital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with technology .
" We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says .
He says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which maturity is not condu@@ ci@@ ve to this . "
" They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
" T@@ elling them not to do it is no good " he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : There are things you wouldn 't tell a stranger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When tag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline .
The rules are the same .
" Outside the Internet , people act with respect , morality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .
Monitoring
Stuart Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thoroughly .
By understanding all the cl@@ auses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
" For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says .
According to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the " don 't talk to strangers " lesson .
Un@@ as@@ ur Summit closes without making public the Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation
The Six@@ th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ dee leaders .
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th UN@@ AS@@ UR Meeting of He@@ ads of State and Government , but Presidential and Chanc@@ ell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peru@@ vian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peru@@ vian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
Journalists ' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audio restricted . "
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokes@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ UR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peru@@ vian Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peru@@ vian President then sent an email to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-@@ Arab Countries ( A@@ SP@@ A ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation was again not made public .
The A@@ SP@@ A official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Peru@@ vian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Sebast@@ i@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago .
" We will o@@ bey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court " said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chil@@ ean counterpart .
" Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , tre@@ ati@@ es and international courts " added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , greeting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ shake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Con@@ fir@@ mation of both presidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á P@@ act , whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Bolivia , E@@ vo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ UR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Host President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lima .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ UR countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . "
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against insecurity and trans@@ national organised crime , actions to make medication more accessible , low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . "
With Europe in crisis , " economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ist attitude but should serve to expand its productive mat@@ rix and glimpse a better future for its people " Hum@@ ala added .
" We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Peru@@ vian President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse a@@ xes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
" We hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ tfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bogota .
" The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega " Santos said .
" We will review all these paths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua " he emphas@@ ised .
" With President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civil@@ ised and respectful manner possible " said Santos .
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country 's new President , Enri@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a Nie@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Paraguay make up UN@@ AS@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tem@@ por@@ e presidency of the regional bloc .
" South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . "
Correa , who took part in the Ele@@ vent@@ h Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) held in Lima , told Peru 's state television that Europeans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now practically one country . "
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ UR .
" We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ dean Community . However , there are still re@@ ac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said .
The Ecu@@ ador@@ ian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the An@@ glo@@ -S@@ ax@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the P@@ act of San José on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything .
" It is in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible that the Inter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks founder Julian As@@ san@@ ge .
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . "
He added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that As@@ san@@ ge would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected . "
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be questioned via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ador@@ ian Embassy in London . "
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of As@@ san@@ ge 's physical and mental health .
" I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the Ecu@@ ador@@ ian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
" That would complic@@ ate the health of any person " he added .
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to As@@ san@@ ge in June by the Ecu@@ ador@@ ian Embassy , in London , through the issue of a safe@@ -@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks founder .
We do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
" The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because As@@ san@@ ge 's lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said .
And he felt that " if Britain says no to the safe@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . "
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr As@@ san@@ ge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or interrog@@ ates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Correa took the opportunity to re@@ assert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is " the medi@@ ocr@@ ity , dishon@@ esty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . "
" The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and w@@ icked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and extortion " he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the bankers or bour@@ ge@@ ois and he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic countries that dominate Ecuador " and said that , if re-elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . "
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UN@@ AS@@ UR , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tolerate opportun@@ ism and a coup masked with leg@@ ality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitimacy of Par@@ agu@@ ayan democracy . "
The Ecu@@ ador@@ ian President also considered the " perfectly pertin@@ ent " desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nicaragu@@ an maritime sovereignty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Con@@ flict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
Additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . "
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . "
Correa said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will retire from public life .
Person@@ ally , I 've never been interested in power , but in situations as un@@ just as those in Ecuador , soci@@ o-@@ economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
" My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , like@@ wise .
" It 's a decision " he confirmed .
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
" This does not mean a health rel@@ apse for President Chavez " he said .
In Lima today , the Ecu@@ ador@@ ian Head of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of He@@ ads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
De@@ aths caused by AIDS are now@@ adays due to late detection
Fabri@@ zio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
" It was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " softer , " apparently unsuccessfully .
The boy hid it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43@@ rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
Fabri@@ zio has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stigma .
Then , even the director of an IM@@ SS [ Mexican Social Security Institute ] clinic refused to discharge him " because he had a cut . "
At that time , having Aids was synon@@ ymous with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , " exhausted " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infections .
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the CH@@ G HIV Unit , Ja@@ ime An@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ an@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
Inf@@ ectious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ an@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non-@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the inter@@ vie@@ wee .
To gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years .
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ alis@@ co alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a compelling statist@@ ic : " Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportun@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . "
Speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in J@@ alis@@ co ( CO@@ ES@@ I@@ DA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabri@@ zio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ pos@@ i sar@@ coma , a canc@@ erous tum@@ our that is one of the common complications .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything .
" If I 'm going to die , I 'd rather have a b@@ low-@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said Fabri@@ zio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MI@@ LE@@ NI@@ O J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should get tested if they are at risk@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which summar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Con@@ doms behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ricardo Salazar , a journalist from Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pack@@ ets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
" Why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ sell@@ ors , pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such in@@ efficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispens@@ ers in places frequ@@ ented by young people .
This is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees , as Governor Emili@@ o Gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
" And it 's not about sexuality , but it is best to provide condoms to those already pract@@ ising sexual activity " he said .
J@@ alis@@ co key points
There are 13,@@ 4@@ 35 cumulative cases ( 12,@@ 158 AIDS and 1,3@@ 17 HIV ) .
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 % via the blood@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ atal .
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4-@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
Rati@@ fied by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which igno@@ res the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solven@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes , contrary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Har@@ lin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mexican firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three in@@ consisten@@ cies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code , the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the in@@ solven@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of in@@ solven@@ cy of companies with trans@@ national profiles .
Indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ form@@ ity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbit@@ rator .
Secon@@ dly , the judgement establ@@ ishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mexican law recogn@@ ises the possibility .
In fact , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a dozen examples , including Agre@@ mex and Commercial Mexic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro creditors who fought against it in the US courts , namely " vul@@ ture " funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capital , Au@@ reli@@ os Conver@@ gence , Elliot International and Liverpool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .
This data is om@@ itted by the Court of Appeal .
From another perspective , the latter blames Vit@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonzalez S@@ ada family firm has lodged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plen@@ ary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court byp@@ assed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of am@@ ic@@ us cur@@ i@@ ae ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Commercial In@@ solven@@ cy Law , noting that the latter discharged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States .
Moreover , it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross-border in@@ solven@@ cy cases , ensuring fairness for deb@@ tors and creditors .
Double wh@@ am@@ my : Vit@@ ro hit and country hit .
Balance She@@ et
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexic@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , Gast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ rag@@ a An@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of mis@@ management , dor@@ man@@ t for several months , the Airline Pil@@ ots Union Association already found the bott@@ len@@ eck .
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstruc@@ ting justice .
The claim is that the supervis@@ ory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pes@@ os from trust F / 58@@ 9 of Banco I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mexic@@ ana de Avi@@ aci@@ ón .
The resources were apparently chann@@ elled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administ@@ ra@@ dor@@ a Prof@@ es@@ ional de Ho@@ tel@@ es .
As you know , Az@@ car@@ rag@@ a An@@ dra@@ de is the main shareholder of the Po@@ sa@@ das hotel chain .
Op@@ posing Dragon Mar@@ t
A group of local and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mar@@ t in Canc@@ un .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
Previously , Can@@ ac@@ in@@ tra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
The death of AC@@ TA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-@@ Counter@@ feit@@ ing Trade Agreement , known by its ac@@ ron@@ ym AC@@ TA , according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archived .
As you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , de@@ em@@ ing it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks .
Home@@ x long term
In effort to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt , the housing developer Home@@ x is placing securities exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pes@@ os .
The issue is the first of four identical issues which are offering to repay interest every 28 days .

Hec@@ tor " H@@ et@@ in " Reyes : " Basketball has been my life "
Basketball glo@@ betro@@ tter Hec@@ tor " H@@ et@@ in " Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world .
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental rec@@ olle@@ ction of local basketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor " H@@ et@@ in " Reyes .
Reyes was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Superior Basketball player , BS@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os or President of the Basketball Federation .
" I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the BS@@ N , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team during the ' 90s , " recalled Reyes during Pri@@ mera Hor@@ a 's visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isabel , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" Basketball has been my life . "
Reyes is not exagger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia den@@ o@@ ting his long career , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ am@@ ón at heart
Of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os , from the mid-@@ 50s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co-@@ agent or agent of the franchise .
" Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-@@ agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981 , Jerome M@@ incy 's debut year in the BS@@ N .
Then " Cu@@ co " Ortiz took over - he was a great manager " said Reyes .
I remember that Gene Bar@@ tow , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " tall .
Do you want him ? '
And that was the beginning of M@@ incy , one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had .
Bar@@ tow then recommended the sharp@@ shooter G@@ aus@@ se Raymond , who established residency here and was one of our best shoo@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ incy had given Bay@@ amon one championship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another .
The V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' championship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ shot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ incy 's accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-@@ Olympics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bronze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes .
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you 've ever seen ?
It 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ incy , G@@ aus@@ se , Ramon Riv@@ as , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ pez and ' Pic@@ ul@@ ín ' ( Ortiz ) , but also the young ( Javier ) ' To@@ ñ@@ ito ' Col@@ ón and James Carter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario ' Qu@@ i@@ jo@@ te ' Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre-@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as ' Can@@ ito ' Nie@@ ves , Pablo A@@ lic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ ando Ho@@ ur@@ ru@@ it@@ iner replacing the players suspended after the sh@@ ambles of the Mar del Plat@@ a Pan@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
Who was the best Puerto Rican player ?
Without any doubt , Pic@@ ul@@ ín Ortiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome .
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Pic@@ ul@@ ín did .
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager ?
That 's a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Julio Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ en@@ dez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ mand@@ ito Torres .
Of the youngsters , I really like the work of Leo Ar@@ ill .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
Having been part of the National Team 's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BS@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I 'd have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor leagues .
For example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily .
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and referees .
That ple@@ ases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
Actor Larry Hag@@ man dies
Larry Hag@@ man , born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ross E@@ wing , better known as " J@@ R , " in the television series " Dallas , " in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manip@@ ulative businessman .
Larry Hag@@ man , whose role as oil tycoon pre@@ dator J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series " Dallas " became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
Hag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new season of " Dallas , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros. , producer of " Dallas . "
" Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked " the family said .
Larry 's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday .
Linda Gray , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her publicist , Jeffrey Lane .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , generous , funny , loving and talented , and I will miss him de@@ arly .
" He was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gray in a statement .
Hag@@ man was diagnosed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years .
In 1995 a mal@@ ignant tum@@ our as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant .
Years before " Dallas , " Hag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy " I Dream of Je@@ ann@@ ie , " aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Captain Tony Nelson , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Barbara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .
He also starred in two sit@@ coms that were not aired for long , " The Good Life " ( NBC , 197@@ 1-@@ 72 ) and " Here We Go Again " ( ABC , 1973 ) .
His film work included roles well received by critics in " The Group , " " Harry and T@@ onto " and " Primary Col@@ ors . "
But it was his master@@ ful interpretation of delight@@ fully de@@ test@@ able J@@ R that led to Hag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom .
The drama series on CBS about the E@@ wing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The tag@@ line " Who shot J@@ R ? , " designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establ@@ ishments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made " Dallas " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " M@@ AS@@ H " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
It was J@@ R 's si@@ ster@@ -in-law Kristin ( played by Mary Crosby ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
Hag@@ man portrayed E@@ wing as a corrupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a charismatic smile : a dishon@@ est entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife , Sue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) , sec@@ tioned .
" I know what I want on J@@ R 's tom@@ bst@@ one " Hag@@ man said in 1988 .
It should read : " Here lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ wing . "
This is the only deal he lost .
Victoria Principal , co-star of the original series , recalled Hag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
He is un@@ for@@ gett@@ able and ir@@ replac@@ eable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
Ten episodes of the new edition of " Dallas " were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hag@@ man .
Hag@@ man , born in Fort Worth , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in classics such as " South Pacific " and " Peter Pan . "
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hag@@ man .
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early ' 50s , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 , in England .
While there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j Ax@@ els@@ son and married her .
The couple had two sons , Preston and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Californ@@ ian city Malibu , home to many celebrities .
In 2001 , he called his memo@@ irs " Hello Dar@@ lin ' : T@@ all ( and Absolutely True ) T@@ ales About My Life . "
" I didn 't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associated Press at the time .
After his liver transplant , he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fearful patients .
" I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards " he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as " Don 't be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . "
He was also an anti-@@ smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
Start of a course that explo@@ res the " End of the World "
Each week , students explore apo@@ calyp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ omb@@ ies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stuart Char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : The end of the " long coun@@ tdown " of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But Char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : The cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic hurricane Sandy , a fiscal precip@@ ice some called " debt Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end-of-@@ the-@@ world Christians theor@@ ists think the A@@ po@@ calyp@@ se will begin .
" I didn 't realise this was going to be the most apo@@ calyp@@ tic term ever " said Char@@ m@@ é this week to students at Rut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Camden University ( New Jersey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an apo@@ calyp@@ tic mentality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theore@@ tically the last in history .
At Temple , Associate Professor Barry V@@ acker is giving the course " Media , Culture and the end of the world . "
Each week , students explore apo@@ calyp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ omb@@ ies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
" We looked at why these ideas prolifer@@ ate over time " he said , and how they offer hypothe@@ tical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students analy@@ sed movies with an apo@@ calyp@@ tic theme and explored how they compare with real-life examples .
" I 've tried to inform students about what is possible , probable , credible and impossible " said V@@ acker .
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Professor Matthew Rest@@ all , and his colleague Amar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an Associate Art History and An@@ thropolog@@ y Professor , have teamed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . "
" We don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn 't come to an end " said Rest@@ all .
Despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , undertake projects and take final exams .
At Penn State , the final exam will be taken on the eve of the A@@ po@@ calyp@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said Rest@@ all .
The courses proved quite popular .
" It was fully booked within two hours " said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high averages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
Students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
" I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves " said Bri@@ dg@@ id Robinson , a 23-year-old post-@@ graduate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ add@@ on@@ field , New Jersey , at Rut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Camden .
And the apo@@ calyp@@ tic , secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it .
Will We@@ kes@@ a , a 25-year-old post-@@ graduate Psych@@ ology and N@@ ursing student , said he had seen all the apo@@ calyp@@ tic movies .
" I 'd never heard of a class that could teach it " he said .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
" Our first project was about the May@@ an proph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we discre@@ dited it " said Julie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 21-year-old final year student at Temple , from West Chester .
The May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
But he said that Western culture suffers from apo@@ calyp@@ tic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these spec@@ ulations .
" In other places , people don 't think about it " he said .
It 's mostly in the English-@@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ gh@@ erty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there .
" The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an indul@@ gence from the Pope .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or philosoph@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end .
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly .
Some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties .
" Maybe I 'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20-year-old communications student .
